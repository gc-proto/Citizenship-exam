        <h3>Why hire internationally trained workers?</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Significant portions of Canada’s workforce have training and experience gained outside Canada. These internationally trained workers (ITWs), including immigrants, refugees, international students and Canadians who trained or worked outside of the country, represent a valuable source of skills and talent and a growing proportion of Canada’s talent pool.</p>  <p>Hiring and retaining ITWs can help you:</p>  <ul> 
 <li><strong>Meet your labour needs.</strong> ITWs will play an increasingly significant role in Canada’s labour force.</li> 
 <li><strong>Increase your competitiveness</strong>. Many ITWs have the skills and talents to help your organization compete in the global marketplace.</li> 
 <li><strong>Access new markets</strong>. ITWs may speak languages and have knowledge of cultures that can help you develop new local and global markets.</li> 
 <li><strong>Make your organization more effective.</strong> ITWs can bring fresh perspectives into your organization, stimulating new thinking and introducing more effective ways of doing business.</li> 
 <li><strong>Connect you with other valuable workers and organizations.</strong> ITWs may be able to link you to other prospective employees and connect your business to useful national or international organizations.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul>  <p>This guide offers information to help you find, assess, hire and retain ITWs. It includes helpful tips, practical tools and useful resources.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Foreign nationals can apply for a work permit to work temporarily in Canada. Many have employer-specific work permits. This means that they can only work for the employer named on their work permit. In some cases, as an employer, you may need to obtain a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) before a work permit can be issued. A positive LMIA will show that there is a need for a foreign worker to fill the job and that no Canadian worker is available.</p>  <p>In other situations, the worker may be exempt from the LMIA requirement. If that is the case, you will still need to provide job offer information directly to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) through the <a href="../partners-service-providers/employer-portal.html">Employer Portal</a>.</p>  <p>Conditions on a temporary work permit can include the work they are permitted to perform, the location of their job, the hours of work and the date when their work permit expires.</p>  <p>Some foreign nationals have an ‘open’ work permit, which allows the individual to work for any employer in Canada.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>You can more effectively access ITWs by identifying and removing barriers in your recruitment, assessment and selection processes.</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Make sure everyone involved in hiring is aware of the value of international skills and credentials.</li> 
 <li>Provide diversity and cross-cultural training to all employees, including those involved in hiring.</li> 
 <li>Focus on the skills and job experience of the candidates rather than on where they came from or where they gained their education and experience.</li> 
 <li>Outline the selection and interview process in your job postings.</li> 
 <li>When advertising jobs, let workers know that you value international credentials and competencies.</li> 
 <li>Let potential candidates know that your workplace is inclusive and that it welcomes diversity.</li> 
 <li>Help prevent exploitation by verifying that any third parties recruiting individuals on your behalf are complying with relevant federal, provincial or territorial laws that regulate recruitment.</li>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Attract the best possible candidates and assess their qualifications fairly and accurately. If you can’t find Canadian citizens or permanent residents to do the job, consider expanding your search to include Express Entry candidates or temporary foreign workers.</p>  <p>There are four steps in any recruitment process:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>defining the job,</li> 
 <li>finding potential candidates,</li> 
 <li>assessing the candidates’ credentials and experience, and</li> 
 <li>selecting the best candidate.</li> 
</ul>  <p>These steps are closely linked. How you define the job will affect the candidates you attract, the way you assess their abilities and your final selection.</p>

 <li>Define the duties, responsibilities and other requirements of the job. The <a href="../../services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code.html">National Occupational Classification</a> can help you determine the main duties or responsibilities, employment requirements and titles for a wide range of occupations.</li> 
 <li>Use information available in your industry. Many industries have developed national standards that can help you define requirements.</li> 
 <li>Specify the licensing or certification required by law for regulated occupations. In some circumstances, it may be possible to hire at a lower level of responsibility and help the</li> 
 <li>candidate obtain the required licensing while on the job, in part by providing workplace experience. If this applies to you, state this in your job postings.</li> 
 <li>Consider voluntary certification that may apply to non-regulated</li> 
 <li>occupations. If you prefer candidates who have this certification, state this in your job postings.</li> 
 <li>Ask for relevant work experience instead of Canadian work experience. For many jobs, relevant work experience is what matters, not the country where the work was done. In some provinces and territories, it is now considered discriminatory to require Canadian experience.</li>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>As an employer, you may be concerned that ITWs are not proficient enough in either English or French to communicate effectively in the workplace.</p>  <p>Communication is important. But before you assess a candidate’s language skills, consider the following:</p>  <ul> 
 <li><strong>What language skills are needed for the job?</strong> Some jobs may not require a high level of language proficiency, while others may need specific job-related language abilities. (See <a href="#_3.3_Assessing_credentials">Assessing credentials and experience</a>)</li> 
 <li><strong>Weakness in language skills can be overcome</strong> through language training or on-the-job experience.</li> 
 <li><strong>Do not be fooled by accents.</strong> Some ITWs may be very proficient in English or French but speak with an accent or use different vocabulary. Keep in mind that some positions require minimal communication skills. Consider filling these positions with candidates who are still learning how to speak English or French proficiently.</li>

         <p>There are many organizations and resources that can help you assess and verify international credentials. Some of these resources are specific to a sector or to an occupation; others are more general.</p>  <p>To apply for permanent residence through one of Canada’s economic immigration programs, potential newcomers may be required to have an Educational Credential Assessment performed by <a href="../../services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html">one of the organizations</a> that have been designated by IRCC. These are not the only organizations performing this service; however they are the only bodies that are recognized to provide assessments for immigration purposes. You may find this assessment useful when determining how international education compares to Canadian standards.</p>  <p>As an employer, understanding and effectively evaluating international credentials and experience will help you to find employees that best meet your needs. To ensure that you have all the information you need, be very specific about what must be submitted alongside a job application. Resources are available, such as the <a href="https://www.cicic.ca/" rel="external">Canadian Information Centre for Credentials</a>, to help you assess both these materials and the ITW candidates.</p>  <p><strong>Foreign Qualification Recognition</strong> is the process of verifying education, training and job experience obtained in another country and comparing it to the standards established for Canadian workers.</p>

You can find some of them through the <a href="https://www.cicic.ca/" rel="external">Canadian Information Centre for Credentials</a>.</p>  <p>These organizations can only assess formal academic educational credentials issued by recognized academic institutions.

You can use these standards to help define language requirements.</p>  <p>The CCLB has worked with language experts in Canada to identify the language level required to work in certain professions. Two methods frequently used are “benchmarking,” which involves a needs assessment of an occupation and occupational language analysis.</p>  <p>An occupational language analysis identifies the language skills required to perform in a job, based on the Essential Skills Profile and the National Occupational Standard, as developed by a sector council or regulatory body.</p>  <p>Several sector councils, national associations and regulatory bodies have also developed sectoral or job-specific language testing and training materials. For regulated occupations, many ITWs have their language skills assessed as part of the licensure process.

         <p>In Canada, federal and provincial laws protect employers and workers. Laws set minimum wage levels, health and safety standards, and hours of work. Human rights laws protect employees from unfair treatment based on many factors, including sex, age, race, religion, or a disability.</p>  <p>In some provinces or territories, requirements for Canadian experience may be viewed as discriminatory. For example, the Ontario Human Rights Commission launched a policy directive denouncing the requirement for “Canadian experience” as discriminatory and suggested very limited circumstances for its use.</p>  <p>Familiarize yourself with these laws. They apply to ITWs. You should also be aware of any provincial or territorial laws that provide additional protection for foreign workers. Following these laws can help ensure that talented staff remain dedicated and loyal to your organization.</p>  <p>In addition to provincial and territorial laws relating to recruitment and employment, employers hiring foreign workers under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or International Mobility Program must comply with program conditions. Consult <a href="../../../employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers.html">Employment and Social Development Canada</a> and <a href="../../services/work-canada/hire-foreign-worker/temporary/international-mobility-program.html">IRCC</a> for more information on employer compliance.</p>

         <p>If you are unable to find candidates already living in Canada with the skills and experience you need, you may want to explore options for recruiting ITWs from overseas. To hire a foreign worker, you must go through one of several federal or provincial/territorial immigration programs.</p>  <ul> 
 <li>It is important that you do further research into what immigration program most suits your needs, as well as your responsibilities, if you choose to support the immigration of an ITW to Canada through one of these immigration streams. <a href="../../services/work-canada/hire-foreign-worker.html">Find more information about employers looking to hire ITWs</a>.</li> 
 <li>To hire a worker temporarily, you must decide if you need to use the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or the International Mobility Program. IRCC provides a service for employers to help them if they are not sure. Find out if you need a Labour Market Impact Assessment.</li> 
 <li>If you need to apply to Service Canada for an LMIA, you should familiarize yourself with the requirements. You will have to show that you have been unable to hire a Canadian or permanent resident for the available job opening. <a href="../../../employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers.html">Find out how to hire a temporary worker through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program</a>.</li> 
 <li>If the position you are hiring for is for a skilled occupation and is permanent or long term, you may wish to consider using the Express Entry system and supporting the individual in applying for permanent residence. <a href="../../services/work-canada/hire-foreign-worker/permanent.html">Find out how to hire permanent workers</a>.</li> 
 <li>Quebec establishes its own immigration requirements and selects newcomers who will adapt well to living in Quebec. Employers should be aware that ITWs who want to come to Canada as Quebec-selected skilled workers must first apply to the <a href="http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/index.html">Quebec government</a> for a certificate of selection (Quebec Selection Certificate).</li> 
 <li>Certain provinces or territories offer wage subsidies to assist employers with hiring newcomers, such as <a href="http://www.emploiquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/citizens/starting-a-new-job/employment-integration-programs/employment-integration-program-for-immigrants-and-visible-minorities-priime/">Quebec’s Employment Integration Program for Immigrants and Visible Minorities</a>.</li>

This will encourage them to welcome additional diversity.</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Design your assessment and selection process to help you determine if the worker can do the job regardless of cultural background.</li>

         <p>Job-bridging programs help internationally trained newcomers enter the labour market in both regulated and non-regulated professions, in which they already have training and experience. This is accomplished through a combination of sector-specific labour market supports. These supports may include job-specific language training, job-search skills, workplace orientation (for example, work placements) and classes that help prepare for the licensing or certification process. In order to fulfill education or other professional requirements, job-bridging programs often include academic and technical training.</p>  <p>Job-bridging programs offer employers valuable opportunities.</p>  <ul> 
 <li>You can sponsor a work placement and potentially hire an ITW, or offer a more permanent position when hiring.</li> 
 <li>You can provide an opportunity for your current ITWs to upgrade their skills in order to meet specific needs, such as licensure or accreditation. This ensures that their skills meet Canadian standards before you make a more permanent hiring commitment.</li>

These include opportunities for employers to connect with newcomers in person and on-line through job fairs, job banks and job matching services coordinated by service provider organizations. Diversity training also helps employers create a welcoming environment.</p>  <p>Immigrant Employment Councils, often funded by IRCC, work to engage thousands of employers. They offer services to help meet the challenges of a diverse workforce, while facilitating mentoring and work opportunities for ITWs. Immigrant Employment Councils provide tools and resources to employers to enhance their capacity for hiring, developing and retaining newcomers. These include diversity and cross-cultural training for staff who are involved in the hiring process.</p>  <p>IRCC’s Employer Liaison Network helps Canadian employers learn about how the immigration system can be used to support hiring needs and to help drive economic growth.</p>  <p>Employers can contact the Network – located in six cities across Canada – to get up-to-date information for both temporary and permanent economic immigration programs and to learn more about the Global Skills Strategy and how to use Express Entry.</p>  <p>The Employer Liaison Network can also help employers connect with skilled workers overseas, including French-speaking or bilingual candidates, and assist Canadian employers of temporary foreign workers already authorized to stay in Canada with their transition to permanent residence.
