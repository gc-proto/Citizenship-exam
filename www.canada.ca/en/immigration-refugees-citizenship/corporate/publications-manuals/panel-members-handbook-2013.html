         <p>Citizenship and Immigration Canada’s (CIC) Health Branch is responsible for the administration and delivery of the Department’s health programs. These responsibilities include management of the panel members (including panel physicians, panel radiologists and laboratories) who perform immigration medical examinations (IMEs) in Canada and abroad.</p>  <p>CIC provides immigration medical services through six regional medical offices (RMOs). In providing these services, the RMOs rely on the IMEs that panel members conduct on clients for permanent residency and some categories of temporary residency in Canada. Health findings on the IMEs allow CIC medical officers to make recommendations on the medical admissibility of persons requesting entry to Canada.</p>  <p>In order to modernize how it conducts its business, CIC is committed to simpler, more accessible services; to continuous, innovative and adaptable operational improvement; and to robust program integrity and delivery of quality service. As part of its modernization agenda, CIC has implemented an electronic IME Web-based processing system called eMedical. eMedical is a joint Canada-Australia information technology project that will result in significant savings in processing time, strengthen overall program integrity, and provide many other benefits for clients, panel members and CIC. Panel members working in countries where eMedical is implemented will need to complete and transmit all IMEs through this Web-based system.</p>  <p>This Handbook provides instructions, information and reference material related to the work of panel members and to the IME process. Panel members may include physicians, radiologists, laboratories and other designated health care professionals involved in the IME process. Together, they make up CIC’s network of panel members.</p>  <p>You can visit the Department’s website at <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/"><strong>cic.gc.ca</strong></a> for further information on Canada’s immigration program.</p>  <p>Issues affecting the health of immigrants and the immigration process itself are subject to change. Periodic updates of this Handbook will be issued when required. These updates will supersede the text they replace. In all cases, the online version of the Handbook will be the most current and is the version that should be consulted.</p>

         <p>Under the <em>Privacy Act</em>, all individuals have the right to the protection of their personal information held by a federal institution. Moreover, Canadian citizens, permanent residents and other individuals present in Canada have the right of access to their own personal information held by government institutions.</p>  <p>Disclosure of personal information is governed by section 8 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>. Subsection 8(1) states that the government institution shall not disclose personal information without the consent of the individual to whom the information relates except under the circumstances provided under subsection 8(2).</p>  <p>Pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(<em>f</em>) of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, Health Branch has concluded Memoranda of Understanding with certain partner countries on information sharing in order to align our network of panel members, which allows Health Branch to share information about our network with partner countries. Health Branch requests that all panel physicians sign a consent form to share information with other immigration health authorities. The information to be shared will not be related to individual clients or a specific type of care; rather it will be generic information concerning administrative (such as email, contact addresses) and operational activities (such as electronic capabilities, locations) as well as information gathered during evaluations, assessments or onsite visits by CIC officers.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>A panel member cannot be designated until all the requirements of the designation process have been met:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Completion of all required forms: 
  <ul> 
   <li>application form;</li> 
   <li>consent to share information;</li> 
   <li>consent to use eMedical where available;</li> 
   <li>acknowledgment of having read the Handbook; and</li> 
   <li>acceptance of designation.</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li>Provision of all required documents, such as proof of professional licence, certification and resumé;</li> 
 <li>Completion of orientation, which includes reading and understanding this Handbook and participating in discussions with CIC medical personnel. Panel members are not authorized to perform IMEs for CIC during the orientation phase; and</li> 
 <li>Completion of training, including eMedical training where and when relevant, which may be done individually or through group activities involving several panel members in locations where they operate in geographic proximity.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Once all forms and documents are received, the regional medical office (RMO) advises the panel member that he/she is approved as a panel member and a unique identifier number is provided.</p>  <p>Designation is not a permanent status and completing the designation process does not create any contract or agency relationship with CIC. A panel member’s designation may be terminated on 30 days’ notice.</p>  <p>CIC does not guarantee that you will receive a specific number of cases per year.</p>  <p>CIC immigration officials and medical officers consult one another regularly in order to determine the number of panel members required in a given location. Based on CIC’s operational requirements, the number of designated panel members in any given location may be reduced or increased.</p>  <p>If a panel member relocates his or her practice, that relocation must be brought to the attention of the RMO, as designation as a panel member is related to your location. Panel member status may be revoked because of the relocation. Upon examination of the new location of the practice and an assessment of the operational requirement for panel members in that location, the affected panel member will be informed of a decision confirming his or her status and given an opportunity to respond.</p>  <p>Complaints or disputes regarding a panel member’s performance may result in termination, depending on the situation. Sections 3.1.8, 3.4.9, and 3.4.10 of this chapter provide additional information on performance evaluations, complaints and the resolution process.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Panel members, depending on their field of work, are authorized to perform IMEs, arrange for diagnostics and investigations, and complete immigration medical forms. They do not have the authority to assess or determine whether the medical conditions of clients are grounds for inadmissibility. More specifically, panel members do not have authority to give clients an opinion on their medical admissibility. That determination rests solely with Canadian immigration officers.</p>  <p>Panel members performing IMEs should ensure that they meet CIC-mandated service standards and that there are no conflicts of interest in providing services. They are also required to help prevent fraud and abuse of Canada’s immigration laws, submit to performance evaluations, follow proper procedures for absences, and use English or French in their communications with CIC.</p>  <p>For all clients, the Canadian IME will include an examination by a panel member and a medical assessment by a CIC medical officer. Where necessary to establish compliance with the IRPA and the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations</em>, clients will be asked to undergo further medical examinations.</p>  <p>The assessment of whether or not a client is inadmissible on health grounds is based on the health findings identified during the examination by a panel member. This process is called the immigration medical assessment (IMA).</p>

         <p>Clear and transparent procedures for responding to complaints and resolving disputes improve client service and the integrity of the immigration medical program. This section explains how CIC will deal with incidents, complaints and quality assurance concerns.</p>  <h5>Incidents occurring during the IME process </h5>  <p>If, during an IME, a panel member has a disagreement with a client, or confusion arises or an event occurs that might compromise client service, panel members should report these incidents to the RMO.</p>  <p>The following are examples of incidents that should be reported:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>The client becomes angry, threatening or violent toward the panel member or staff;</li> 
 <li>The client claims that the panel member is deliberately delaying the IME process or requesting unnecessary investigations for personal gain;</li> 
 <li>The client refuses to undergo parts of the examination or investigation;</li> 
 <li>The panel member or clinic staff become aware of attempts by the client to falsify certain aspects of the IME, or clinical or laboratory investigations;</li> 
 <li>The panel member or clinic staff are asked to overlook or alter some aspects of the IME, or of clinical or laboratory investigations;</li> 
 <li>The client threatens to complain about the IME service or the IME process itself; or</li> 
 <li>The panel member feels that reporting a one of a kind situation may benefit the program or increase other panel members’ knowledge.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Reports to the RMO should include the date of the incident, the client’s IME, UMI or UCI number and a brief description of the incident.</p>  <h5>Complaints </h5>  <p>Complaints are common in any client service procedure. Complaints regarding the IME and related services may arise from clients or other persons outside CIC. In addition, CIC personnel may provide critical comments or notifications of errors, performance issues or situations of concern regarding the IME and related services. Affected panel members will receive a letter of concern from the RMO and be given an opportunity to reply to the complaint. In accordance with the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, privacy rules will not be breached when sharing the content of the complaint.</p>  <p>CIC’s Health Branch will consider the opinions and viewpoints of panel members and of anyone submitting a complaint or critical comment.</p>  <h5>Quality assurance concerns </h5>  <p> Health Branch officers will occasionally visit panel members to ensure the quality of their work. If concerns are found, the panel members will be asked to address them in a timely manner.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Failure to meet performance standards may result in termination of the panel member’s designation. The following are examples of situations where panel members or their clinic staff would be seen to be failing to meet performance standards:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Unacceptable behaviour or demonstrated misconduct: 
  <ul> 
   <li>unprofessional or unethical conduct or activities;</li> 
   <li>illegal activities; and</li> 
   <li>loss or suspension of medical licence.</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li>Continued failure to maintain an acceptable level of performance as set out in this Handbook or in accordance with written instructions from the RMO. This includes continued or repeated deficiencies after notification, in the following: 
  <ul> 
   <li>timely and correct completion of IMEs (including errors or omissions in the medical history and physical examination of clients);</li> 
   <li>appropriately providing requisite laboratory and clinical investigations and activities;</li> 
   <li>gathering and management of medical information;</li> 
   <li>timely transfer of information and communication with the CIC Health Branch; and</li> 
   <li>following the instructions in this Handbook.</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul>  <h5>Resolution of issues </h5>  <p>Minor incidents and/or performance deficiencies will be addressed by the RMO in a letter outlining the necessary remedial or corrective measures, which may include additional training.</p>  <p>For serious complaints, such as harassment, sexual misconduct or illegal activities, the RMO will suspend the panel member, issue a letter summarizing the facts that gave rise to the complaint and provide the panel member with an opportunity to reply. While the panel member’s designation is suspended, IME activities by the panel member cease until the panel member is notified that he or she has been reinstated by CIC.</p>  <p>Upon receipt of the panel member’s reply, the RMO will conduct an assessment. If the response is deemed satisfactory, the panel member will be informed of the decision and be reinstated with appropriate recommendations. If the response is unsatisfactory, the panel member’s designation will be terminated.</p>  <h5>Termination </h5>  <p>CIC retains complete authority over the management of the panel member network. The number of panel members required may change in response to the local demand for IMEs. Panel physicians who are terminated because of operational needs will be notified in writing by the RMO at least 30 days prior to any such change in the network.</p>  <p>However, if the panel member’s designation is terminated because of performance deficiencies or complaints, there is no transition period and the termination is effective as of the date of the notification letter sent by the RMO.</p>  <h5>Retirement and resignation </h5>  <p>Panel members may retire or request removal from the panel network at any time. Panel members should send written notification to the RMO, including the anticipated date on which activity will cease.</p>  <h5>Request for reconsideration </h5>  <p>Panel members may request a reconsideration of a termination letter. Panel members should submit their request for reconsideration in writing within 30 days of receipt of the termination letter to:</p>

         <p>In Canada, CIC is committed to providing clients with the opportunity to receive their IME in their preferred official language, either English or French. If a panel physician is unable to provide service in the preferred official language of the client, he/ she should refer the client to the nearest panel physician who can.

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>In addition to the <em>Privacy Act</em>, the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, the Canadian <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>and the <em>Library and Archives Act</em>, personal information in Canada is protected under the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act </em>(PIPEDA) and under provincial and territorial privacy legislation. The laws of other jurisdictions where the information is collected may also apply. Panel physicians must<br> comply with these laws when collecting information because the laws set out principles for the collection, use, disclosure, retention and disposal of personal information.</p>  <p>In order to comply with legislation, the IME forms, in some instances, require clients to consent to the disclosure of their personal health information to third parties. In addition, personal health information must be collected and stored in such a way that it is protected from unauthorized disclosure. Panel physicians in Canada receive advice from their professional organizations or regulating bodies on how the PIPEDA and provincial or territorial privacy legislation are to be applied, as well as on the steps required to properly manage information. The PIPEDA can be viewed at <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/P-8.6/">http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/P-8.6/</a>.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Refugee claimants (often referred to as asylum seekers) are individuals who, following their arrival in Canada, make a formal claim to a CIC or Canada Border Services Agency officer requesting Canada’s protection.</p>  <p>Under the IRPA, all persons claiming refugee protection must undergo an IME. The IME forms and requirements for this refugee group are the same as for other immigrants.</p>  <p>As stated earlier in this Handbook, immigrants are examined in order to identify medical conditions that might affect their admissibility to Canada under the IRPA (see <a href="#chap2.1">Section 2.1</a>). Refugee claimants are EDE. This means that they are examined primarily to identify conditions that might pose risks to public health and public safety; however, any additional services required by the IMEIs may also be provided.</p>  <p>Refugee claimants are referred for their IME when they file their claims. They are given medical instructions and a list of panel physicians. They must undergo their IME within 30 days following their claim for refugee status.</p>  <p>Refugee claimants who have been granted protected person status by the Canadian authorities become eligible to apply for provincial or territorial health insurance. They must undergo a second IME as part of their application for permanent residence.<br> They are also given medical instructions and a list of panel physicians. The medical examination is to be undertaken within 90 days of issuance of the IME form IMM 1017.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Refugee claimants may be eligible to have some of their health costs covered under the IFHP. This program, funded by CIC, provides limited, temporary coverage of costs related to health care for specific categories of people, including protected persons, refugee claimants, rejected refugee claimants, certain persons detained under the IRPA and other specified groups. Adjudication and payment of claims for the program is provided by the IFHP Claims Administrator, Medavie Blue Cross.</p>  <p>A panel member and any other providers assisting with IME-related tests must register as an IFHP Provider with Medavie Blue Cross, comply with the provider’s terms and conditions, and follow all procedures for clients eligible under this program.</p>  <p>With the reform of the IFHP, effective on June 30, 2012, the following changes were applicable:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>The IFHP does not cover the cost of IMEs for protected persons. Other paid medical IME and related tests for individuals determined to be protected persons by the IRB are no longer covered under the IFHP. Protected persons are responsible for paying for the costs of their IME.</li> 
 <li>The IFHP will continue to cover the cost of IMEs and related tests for refugee claimants.</li> 
 <li>The IFHP will not cover IMEs or related tests for rejected refugee claimants.</li> 
</ul>  <p>For more information on the IFHP, visit <a href="../../services/refugees/help-within-canada/health-care.html"><strong>cic.gc.ca/ifhp</strong></a>.</p>  <p>As a general rule, only panel physicians are authorized to perform IMEs for IFHP beneficiaries. In certain cases, CIC may approve a non-panel physician. It is important to note that unless authorized by CIC to perform IMEs, Medavie Blue Cross will not reimburse non-panel physicians for this service and the examination documents will not be accepted by CIC as an IME.</p>

        <h4>Important Information</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <h5>Verifying IFHP eligibility </h5>  <ul> 
 <li>Panel physicians <strong>must </strong>check with Medavie Blue Cross that their patient’s IFHP coverage is still current <strong>BEFORE </strong>the examination is carried out because client eligibility may be cancelled or modified without notice should their immigration status change. For example, if a beneficiary receives IFHP coverage as a detainee, once released from detention, their IFHP detainee coverage is terminated. They must then reapply to CIC to have their previous IFHP coverage reinstated in order to continue to be covered under the program. Please also note that because of normal delays between the production and uploading of the files, it can take 2 working days for an IFHP beneficiary’s coverage to become active in Medavie Blue Cross’ system.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Panel physicians cannot refuse to provide IMEs for persons covered by the IFHP but may charge for missed appointments in accordance with local standards of practice. This charge will not be reimbursed under the IFHP.</p>  <h5>Coding benefits </h5>  <ul> 
 <li>CIC determines the fees for IMEs and related tests when reimbursed under the IFHP. The current IFHP codes and fees can be found in the IFHP Benefit Grid – IME and IME Tests at <a href="https://provider.medavie.bluecross.ca/">https://provider.medavie.bluecross.ca</a> under section <em>Benefit Grid/Drug Formulary</em>.</li> 
 <li>Panel physicians submitting claims for IMEs and related tests must use the appropriate benefit codes listed in the IME Benefit Grid.</li> 
</ul>  <h5>Billing for services </h5>  <ul> 
 <li>Invoices for services listed in the IME Benefit Grid must be sent to Medavie Blue Cross.</li> 
 <li>Panel physicians <strong>must not </strong>ask patients who are eligible for IFHP IME coverage to pay surcharges or additional costs, or ask for a deposit or any other fee in connection with the IME.</li> 
</ul>  <p>The IFHP provides coverage for more than the IME, as described in the <strong>IFHP Information Handbook for Health Care Professionals </strong>(Provider Handbook). <strong>Chapter 9 </strong>in the Provider Handbook contains important information for panel physicians who perform IMEs for refugee claimants.</p>  <p>The Provider Handbook, IFHP Benefit Grid and all other program information, including prior approval procedures, claim submission guidelines, provider terms and conditions as well as payment procedures can be found online at <a href="https://provider.medavie.bluecross.ca/">https://provider.medavie.bluecross.ca</a>.</p>
