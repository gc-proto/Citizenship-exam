<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>I am pleased to present this year’s Annual Report, highlighting the tremendous work undertaken to deliver Canada’s Passport Program during fiscal year 2013–2014.</p>  <p>The Passport Program operates on a cost-recovery basis through a revolving fund, financing its operations entirely from the fees charged for passport and other travel document services. This Annual Report allows the Passport Program to answer directly to passport holders and Canadians on its performance and how revenues collected through fees are being spent. It elaborates on the program information set out in the <em>Departmental Performance Report </em>for 2013–2014 for Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).</p>  <p>This past year marked an important turning point in how the Passport Program is managed by the Government of Canada. On July 2, 2013, primary responsibility for the Passport Program was transferred from Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada to my department, CIC. This sensible move allows for a natural alignment with the duties performed by CIC, such as determining Canadian citizenship, which is a requirement to apply for a passport. Employment and Social Development Canada, through Service Canada, is responsible for passport service delivery in Canada, and Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada is responsible for passport services abroad. The transfer of the Passport Program to CIC was done without any service disruptions to Canadians.</p>  <p>During the reporting period, the Passport Program also introduced the 10-year electronic passport (ePassport), making the document more difficult to forge or alter, while offering greater convenience and savings to passport holders. I am proud to say that the Passport Program’s 10-year ePassport team has received a Public Service Award of Excellence in the category Excellence in Citizen-Focused Service Delivery for their work.</p>  <p>In parallel, the Passport Program introduced a new fee structure that enables the program to offer ePassports with a 5-year or a 10-year validity period, keep pace with technological advancements and continue to provide excellent service to Canadians. In addition, the new 10-year passport offers greater convenience to passport holders, since it is only necessary to submit an application once every 10 years, thus reducing their administrative burden.&nbsp;Holders of 10-year passports in Canada, who are the vast majority, receive a high-value, secure ePassport for a lower annual cost than the previous non-electronic passport.</p>  <p>With a new fee structure and a realignment of the Passport Program within the Government of Canada, CIC has embarked on its ambitious Modernization Initiative. Working with Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada, CIC will transform the Passport Program in order to strengthen security and integrity, improve accessibility, and increase efficiency over the coming years. This initiative is a direct response to our commitment to Canadians to modernize the way we do business, which was made during our public consultations under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/U-3.7/"><em>User Fees Act</em></a> leading to a passport fee increase in 2013.</p>  <p>I invite you to read all about this year’s impressive accomplishments in the following pages.</p>  <p>Robert Orr<br> Assistant Deputy Minister, Operations</p>

         <p>Since July 2013, the Passport Program has been part of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). The <em>Canadian Passport Order</em> provides the Minister of CIC with authority over the Passport Program mandate. Responsibilities of the Passport Program include issuing, refusing to issue, revoking, withholding, recovering, and providing instructions on the use of Canadian passports. Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), through Service Canada, assumes responsibility for passport delivery in Canada, and Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD) continues to be responsible for passport services abroad<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>.</p>  <p>Through the Passport Program, CIC facilitates travel for Canadians and contributes to a safe and secure travel regime, by issuing Canadian travel documents that are internationally recognized and respected. The Passport Program ensures that legitimate travellers are in possession of Canadian travel documents, that potential applicants are informed and understand their responsibilities of applying for and possessing Canadian travel documents, and that the needs of Canadian travel document holders are met.</p>  <p>To achieve these outcomes, employees within the Passport Program manage passport application intake, authenticate identity, confirm eligibility and manage the issuance and delivery of travel documents to eligible travellers. They also perform activities to ensure that fraud and misuse of travel documents are prevented and detected.</p>  <p>The Passport Program’s clientele is the “travelling public”. Sixty-five percent of Canadians hold a travel document and 21.6 million Canadian travel documents were in circulation as of March 31, 2014.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The Passport Program issued 4.9 million travel documents in 2013–2014, 98% of which were regular “blue” passports. The regular passport has 36 pages and its maximum validity period varies with the age of the passport holder: adults (16 years of age or older) have the option of a 5-year or 10-year passport; children’s passports (0 to 15 years of age) are issued for a maximum of 5 years. Please see Annex A for a description of types of Canadian travel documents.</p>  <p>The Passport Program also offers expedited services to clients, such as an urgent 1-day service and administrative services, including certified true copies—an official certification dated and sealed by the Passport Program that the copy is true and authentic.</p>  <p>The passport fee for adults in Canada is $120 for a 5-year passport and $160 for a 10-year passport<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>. Annex B highlights the complete list of passport services and associated fees.</p>  <p>The Passport Program has service standards for the services for which it charges fees.

 <li>two weeks (10 business days) for passport applications received in person at a Passport Canada-branded regional office;</li>

        <h4>Service Delivery Model</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Designating ESDC as responsible for passport services in Canada and DFATD for passport services abroad allows the Government of Canada to leverage the extensive in-person network of Service Canada offices across the country and DFATD’s network abroad. CIC continues to process applications for refugee travel documents, certificates of identity, and diplomatic and special passports. The program is working toward providing Canadians with access to passport services through a “single window” rather than having segmented Government of Canada service options for passports, as well as generating operating efficiencies. In addition, this model allows CIC to focus on the critical function of ensuring the integrity of the Passport Program. That being said, CIC, ESDC and DFATD work collaboratively to strike the best possible balance between integrity, client service, and operating efficiency.</p>

        <h4>Service Delivery Network</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Canadians can access passport services through several service channels. Completed application forms may be submitted in person at one of the 34 Passport Canada-branded regional offices or receiving agent locations (i.e. 144 Service Canada and 44 Canada Post locations) shown on the map in Figure 1, mailed to a central processing centre, or submitted via the applicant’s Member of Parliament. Today, over 95% of Canadians residing in Canada have access to passport services within 100 km of their place of residence. Canadians living or travelling abroad can access passport services through just over 200 DFATD points of service abroad. Finally, Canadians can obtain information through the Passport Canada-branded Web site (passportcanada.gc.ca), the Passport Program’s toll-free number (1-800-567-6868), social media, or through any of the service locations mentioned above.</p>  <h5 id="figure1">Figure 1: Passport Points of Service</h5>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Figure 2 shows Canadians’ continued preference for in-person service at a Passport Canada-branded office. However, in recent years, the number of clients submitting applications at regional offices has steadily decreased. In fiscal year 2005–2006, 83% of all applications received were through a regional office, compared to just over 66% in 2013–2014. This may be attributed to the addition of over 100 receiving agents since 2007 and the convenience of having such offices closer to clients. The percentage of applications received through receiving agents continues to increase, up from 4% in 2006–2007 to 13.4% in 2013–2014.</p>  <p>Canadians are also submitting more applications by mail (14.4% in 2013–2014). The simplified renewal option introduced in 2007 has increased Canadians’ confidence in sending applications by mail, as official documents, such as documentary evidence of citizenship, are not required.</p>  <p>The remaining applications received in 2013–2014 were submitted outside Canada (3.4%) or through the office of a Member of Parliament (2.1%) or were for types of documents other than a regular (blue) passport (0.4% of applications were for a certificate of identity, a refugee travel document or a special/diplomatic passport).</p>  <h5 id="figure2">Figure 2: Applications Received by Channel 2013–2014</h5>

        <h3 id="sec_1_funded">1.4 How Passports Are Funded</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The Passport Program operates on a cost-recovery basis, financing its operations entirely from the fees charged for passport and other travel document services. In other words, passports are not financed by taxpayers; only those who apply for a passport actually pay for this service. As a full cost-recovery program, the Passport Program must generate sufficient revenues to meet its mandate.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/R-8/"><em>Revolving Funds Act</em></a> provides the Minister of CIC with authority to make expenditures out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) to provide passport and other travel document services in Canada and abroad. The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2012-253/FullText.html"><em>Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations</em></a> made pursuant to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-1.html"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a> provide the Government of Canada with the authority to collect user fees and deposit revenues into the CRF.</p>  <p>Unique administrative and reporting requirements apply to revolving funds, pursuant to the Treasury Board <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12248"><em>Policy on Special Revenue Spending Authorities</em></a>. Audited financial statements must be prepared annually for the Passport Program, in accordance with Treasury Board Secretariat accounting policies based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The statements are published annually in the <em>Public Accounts of Canada</em> and are also included in this report to provide context for the financial figures. Section 3 provides more details on the Passport Program 2013–2014 financial results and Annex D presents the program’s 2013–2014 financial statements.</p>  <p>A strong governance framework is in place to ensure compliance with the <em>Revolving Funds Act, </em>the <em>Policy on Special Revenue Spending Authorities,</em> and effective management of Passport Program investments. Among initiatives put in place, CIC has a stage gating approach to identify, prioritize and manage the intake of opportunities, and allocate resources.</p>  <p>CIC has also created measures to ensure that the accounts related to the Passport program are properly segregated in order to monitor the cost and expenditures against this program. In addition, the robust passport demand forecast, the agreement with ESDC on the deliverance of passport services on behalf of CIC and the support of activity-based management to facilitate the budgetary allocation minimize financial risks for the Passport Program.</p>

         <p><em>Ensure use of modern management practices to anticipate and respond to future needs, including alignment with CIC and Government of Canada business processes and systems, innovation and decision making.</em></p>  <p>The Passport Program is one of the few Government of Canada programs to operate on a full cost-recovery basis. As mentioned in Section 1.4, activity-based management practices and robust forecasting have enabled the program to maximize the use of its resources, assess the value of new initiatives, and implement timely resource re-allocation strategies in sync with forecasted changes to passport demand.</p>  <p>Strong and innovative management practices are at the core of the program’s success. In response to the Government of Canada’s objective to strive for service improvements for Canadians and greater operating cost efficiencies, and in the context of the Administrative Services Review, an assessment of the delivery of passport services was undertaken by an independent assessor in fall 2011. The assessment concluded that the Passport Program’s financial situation limited its capacity to modernize and deterred investment on the scale required to enhance security and introduce e-services. Such conclusions lead to a machinery change to gain support from partner organizations with successful experience in technology and service modernization.</p>  <p>At all times, policies, program management, and partnerships must be effectively managed to strike the appropriate balance between program delivery and integrity priorities.</p>

        <h4>Performance in 2013–2014</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The Passport Program issued 4.9 million travel documents in 2013–2014. The number of passports issued annually has increased steadily over the last decade, with a sharp increase in 2007 due to the United States’ implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative requiring all travelers, including Canadians, to show a passport when entering the United States.</p>  <p>The Passport Program’s demand for services forecast continued to play a key role in helping the organization manage its resources as efficiently as possible to maintain service levels through fluctuations in demand for passport services. For example, the 2013–2014 passport sales confirmed the program’s forecast for a strong preference for the 10-year validity option, with just over 80% of adult Canadians preferring the 10-year to the 5-year passport, as projected.</p>  <h5>Key accomplishments in 2013—2014 include:</h5>  <ul> 
 <li><strong>Transferred responsibility of the Passport Program to CIC</strong> on July 2, 2013 without any interruption in service. ESDC, through Service Canada, is now responsible for passport service delivery in Canada, and DFATD remains responsible for passport services abroad.</li> 
 <li><strong>Introduced a new fee structure</strong> allowing the Passport Program to generate sufficient revenues to deliver its mandate in regard to passport integrity and client service, and sustain the program as a whole over a 10-year business cycle.</li> 
 <li><strong>Incorporated an investment fund within the new fee structure</strong> to ensure the means to update and modernize the way the Passport Program does business, continue to improve upon the security of the passport itself, and maintain a high level of client service.</li> 
 <li><strong>Embarked on the ambitious Passport Program Modernization Initiative.</strong> The goals of this initiative are grouped under three components: (1) activities to complete the transfer of the Passport Program to CIC and ESDC, including transition and rationalization of internal services; (2) modernization of business process, including replacing the current passport issuing system with the Global Case Management System (GCMS), introducing online e-application and self-serve options, and increasing integrity through linkages with security partners; and (3) optimization of the service delivery network to ensure continued flexibility to adapt to government needs and priorities and achieve efficiencies. This initiative is being planned as a phased approach over a 5-year period, from 2013—2014 to 2017-2018 with the aim of enhancing security and integrity, modernizing service through the use of CIC’s technological platform and Service Canada’s service delivery network. The plans for Phase I, from July 2013 to June 2015, are focused on transition and planning, with some implementation, while Phase II plans, from July 2015 to June 2018, are focused on implementation.</li>

         <p><em>Ensure that the reputation of the Canadian travel document and confidence in Passport Program are maintained.</em></p>  <p>Maintaining the integrity of the Passport Program is critical. Canada’s Passport Program is an important component of our country’s security infrastructure and helps to mitigate security threats. Research shows that when acquiring a passport, Canadians look for strong security features, recognition of the passport by foreign authorities, and visa-free access to other countries. All of these factors relate to integrity and depend on the Passport Program’s capacity to enhance security features of the passport, build and maintain effective partnerships, detect fraud, and ensure that the Canadian passport is not used to facilitate travel by high-risk individuals.</p>  <p>For the reporting year, business priorities were established mindful of an evolving environment marked by increasingly sophisticated identity theft and fraud, with fraudsters seeking to fraudulently obtain genuine passports rather than trying to tamper with an existing document, as well as genuine travel documents and identities becoming enablers, to travel abroad to do harm.</p>

         <p>According to the 2013 Henley Visa Restrictions Index, Canada is among the top countries in the world in terms of visa-free access to other countries. This high level of travel freedom is a reflection of Canada’s relationships within the international community, as well as the high regard for the Canadian passport.</p>  <p>The security and integrity of the Canadian passport and its issuing system are subject to intense and ongoing scrutiny. The <em>Canadian Passport Order</em> provides a legal basis for decisions rendered by the Minister to refuse or revoke a passport. Investigations into concerns related to identity, suspected fraudulent activity or misuse of a passport resulted in 308 cases of refusal of passport services and 467 cases of revocation of passports in 2013–2014.</p>  <p>In addition, sections 69 and 70 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-1.4/index.html"><em>Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act</em></a> (FOAEAA) give the Minister the authority to suspend or refuse to renew or to issue a passport to an individual upon being informed by the Minister of Justice that he or she is subject to a license denial application due to child support payment arrears. In 2013–2014, a total of 2,067 individuals were subject to suspensions or refusal of a passport pursuant to FOAEAA (1,428 suspensions and 639 refusals).</p>  <p>Passports that are lost or stolen are also monitored for security reasons. In 2013–2014, 65,717 passports out of a total of 22.5 million of passports in circulation were reported lost or stolen. This represents 0.29% of all the passports in circulation during this period. Information regarding lost and stolen passports is shared with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canada Border Services Agency and Interpol for inclusion in their respective databases in order to mitigate the risk of unauthorized use of invalidated passports. </p>  <h5>Key accomplishments in 2013—2014 include:</h5>  <ul> 
 <li><strong>Introduced the ePassport</strong> as committed in Budget 2008 and in the Speech from the Throne of March 3, 2010. As of July 1, 2013, a chip was integrated in travel documents printed in Canada. The new electronic passport is a major milestone in improving the security of the passport. The book's many digital security features reduce the risk of tampering and identity fraud, and help border authorities ensure a book's authenticity. The adoption of the ePassport puts Canada into closer alignment with its international partners, and builds on the future directions and recommended practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).</li> 
 <li><strong>Expanded the efficiency of the Facial Recognition Program</strong> in collaboration with the Five Nations Passport Group partners (an international forum of passport issuing authorities in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada) to allow the detection of identity fraud in the passport entitlement and issuance processes and ensure minimal instances of travel documents issued to ineligible parties. Facial recognition technology is one of the pillars of the Passport Program’s fraud detection strategy. It was fully incorporated into passport application processing in 2010–2011. It compares photos provided with passport applications against facial images in the passport databases.</li> 
 <li><strong>Reinforced working relationships</strong> with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canada Border Services Agency and Public Safety Canada focussing on security threats with a special emphasis on Canadians involved in foreign conflicts. This information sharing network has proven effective in the detection of fraud and will contribute to building appropriate safeguards, controls and oversight mechanisms to limit the use of the passport for the purpose of travelling to engage in unlawful acts.</li> 
 <li><strong>Completed Passport Program risk assessments in the Asia-Pacific region and a Passport Program integrity risk assessment for the Greater Toronto Area.</strong> These risk assessments provide insight into threats and risks that may be unique to a mission or geographic area of responsibility, client profile, and/or operating environment, which provide information for missions and Service Canada on passport service delivery and the supporting tools and strategies.</li> 
 <li><strong>Performed a program- threat and risk assessment on the Shared Services Canada IT network infrastructure that is currently supporting the Passport Program.</strong> The report was released on March 12, 2014. Several of the recommendations are currently under development.</li> 
 <li><strong>Participated in various international fora</strong>, including with the International Civil Aviation Organization, the G8 and Five Nations Passport Group, to support work on travel document design, security, and the program’s capacity to detect identity fraud.</li>

         <p><em>Ensure the Passport Program is responsive to heightened client service expectations.</em></p>  <p>Canadians expect high-quality passport services, which includes a straightforward passport application process and the time it takes to obtain a passport. Despite excellent levels of client satisfaction, the Passport Program continues to evolve to ensure its ability to meet clients’ needs in years to come, recognizing for example that Canadians want access to a full range of federal government programs and services electronically, including passport services.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The Passport Program has consistently achieved superior levels of client satisfaction. In a year of transition and significant change, the Passport Program delivered on its promise not to disrupt service to Canadians and in fact, exceeded its service standards with 99% of clients receiving their passport on time or earlier (see Annex C for more details).</p>  <p>The program continued to offer support and information to passport applicants and passport holders through its call center and Web site. We answered about 1,405,430 calls in 2013–2014, with 95.4% of clients waiting eight minutes or less in the telephone queue. We recorded over 10 million visits to our Web site from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. The Web site <strong>Contact Us </strong>section allows users to share their concerns, provide us with feedback, request the status of their passport application or ask questions related to the Canadian passport. In 2013–2014, we received 52,130 requests for the status of passport applications and&nbsp;32,352 general queries.</p>  <p class="well"><em>The Passport Program was publically recognized by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, for cutting red tape for small businesses by introducing a 10-year validity passport.</em></p>  <h5>Key accomplishments in 2013–2014 include:</h5>  <ul> 
 <li><strong>Completed the deployment of the 10-year passport</strong>, offering greater convenience and savings to passport holders, since it is only necessary to pay for photos and submit an application once every 10 years, thus reducing their administrative burden. The 2013–2014 passport sales confirm a strong preference for the 10-year option, with just over 80% of adult Canadians preferring the 10-year to the 5-year passport.</li> 
 <li><strong>Implemented an internal and external communication strategy for the new passport services that came into effect on July 1, 2013.</strong> This included the development of communication activities and products for Canadians and employees and updates to the application forms and to the Passport Program’s Web site. The program raised awareness of the ePassport, by creating YouTube videos and dedicating a section of its Web site to frequently asked questions. Extensive communication activities were carried out to ensure that applicants had the required information on the validity options and the new fee.</li> 
 <li><strong>Introduced a new passport holder guarantor policy for applications submitted outside Canada</strong>. The new process allows Canadian passport applicants abroad to choose a Canadian adult passport holder to act as their guarantor.</li> 
 <li><strong>Updated the list of occupations from which Canadians abroad can choose a guarantor</strong> to include occupations that are more easily found around the world.</li> 
 <li><strong>Provided travel document assistance to distressed Canadians in crisis situations</strong>, including the civil unrest in Juba (South Sudan), the mall shootings in Nairobi (Kenya) and the conflict in Cairo (Egypt), in collaboration with DFATD.</li> 
 <li><strong>Issued free replacement of passports lost or damaged</strong> as a result of the floods in Southern Alberta and the Lac-Mégantic railway disaster.</li>

        <h2 id="sec_3">Section 3 - Passport Program Financial Results</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Since the Passport Program operates under a revolving fund, it has a continuing non-lapsing authority from Parliament that allows for the accumulation and carryover of surplus revenues from year to year to offset future shortfalls. When revenues exceed expenditures, the Passport Program accumulates a surplus in its Accumulated Net Charge Against the Fund Authority (ANCAFA), essentially a bank account. This surplus can then be used to fund the Passport Program’s deficits during years when revenues do not cover expenditures.</p>  <p>The Passport Program expects to generate a surplus in revenues until 2017–2018. These financial surpluses will be used to compensate the anticipated reduction in revenue during the second half of the business cycle, starting in 2018–2019. The significant drop in revenues in the second half of the business cycle is caused by an abrupt reduction in passport demand due to the introduction of a 10-year passport in July 2013. During this second half of the business cycle, the Passport Program requires accumulated surpluses to sustain operations as there are many fixed costs associated with maintaining the infrastructure that supports Passport Program delivery that do not vary with passport volume fluctuations.</p>  <p>The Passport Program must generate sufficient revenues to sustain operations over a 10-year business cycle (from 2013–2014 to 2023–2024), with no negative impact on the fiscal framework, as was committed to Canadians and parliamentarians in the consultations process to increase passport fees in 2013.</p>

        <h3>Financial results for 2013—2014</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The new fee structure introduced in July 2013 brings positive changes to the Passport Program’s financial position. In fiscal year 2013–2014, actual revenues were $534 million compared to $312 million in 2012–2013, which represents an increase of $222 million as a result of the passport services fee increase.</p>  <p>Passport Program’s operating expenditures were at $337 million, an increase of 5% compared to the previous year. This is primarily a result of the introduction of the ePassport.</p>  <p>The program generated a surplus of $187<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> million in 2013–2014. As indicated above, the Passport Program has started building funds in its ANCAFA in order to be able to cover for low passport demand starting in 2018–2019.</p>  <p>The Passport Program’s financial statements for 2013–2014 may be found in Annex D. The statements have been audited by an external firm to confirm that they fairly represent the financial position of the revolving fund. For the fourth consecutive year, the auditors have issued no observations resulting from their audit.</p>

         <p>Looking ahead, CIC will continue to improve the Passport Program by focusing activities around the program’s three strategic themes: Program Management, Integrity, and Service to make the Passport Program efficient, ensuring Canadians value for money from the fees they pay, and effective in facilitating secure travel for Canadians.</p>  <p>In fiscal year 2014–2015, the Passport Program will intensify efforts to advance the Modernization Initiative, including:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>enhancing passport services and program integrity by strengthening business processes and enabling systems while ensuring the financial sustainability of the Passport Program;</li> 
 <li>strengthening the security and integrity of the Passport Program by undertaking security-oriented improvements in alignment with Passport Program modernization, Government of Canada priorities and international standards; and</li> 
 <li>adopting common Government of Canada administrative business processes and optimizing synergies with CIC practices and systems.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Moving forward, input and ideas gathered from Canadians during our public consultations under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/U-3.7/"><em>User Fees Act</em></a> will continue to shape the way the Passport Program is delivered in the future.</p>

         <p><strong>Regular passport:</strong> The regular (blue) passport is issued to Canadian citizens for occasional travel, such as vacations and business trips. The regular passport has 36 pages. The current maximum validity period varies with the age of the passport holder:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Adults (16 years of age or over): have the option of a 5-year or 10-year passport</li> 
 <li>Children's passport (0 to 15 years of age): issued for a maximum of 5 years</li>

         <p>To the Assistant Deputy Minister and Chief Financial Officer, Citizenship and Immigration Canada</p>  <p>We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Passport Canada Revolving Fund (the “Fund”) which comprise the statement of financial position as at March 31, 2014, the statements of operations and changes in net assets and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.</p>  <p>Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the reporting requirements of Section 4 of the Treasury Board of Canada’s Policy on Special Revenue Spending Authorities and the <em>Revolving Funds Act</em>, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</p>  <p>Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.</p>  <p>An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.</p>  <p>We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.</p>  <p>In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at March 31, 2014, and the results of its operations and the changes in its deficit and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the reporting requirements of Section 4 of the Treasury Board of Canada’s Policy on Special Revenue Spending Authorities and the <em>Revolving Funds Act</em>.</p>  <p>Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 2 to the financial statements which describe the basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared solely for the information and use of the management of the Revolving Fund, Assistant Deputy Minister and Chief Financial Officer, Citizenship and Immigration Canada and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for reporting on the use of the Fund authority. The financial statements are not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than the specified users or for any other purpose.</p>  <p>Signed by KPMG LLP</p>  <p>Chartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants</p>  <p>May 26, 2014<br> Ottawa, Canada</p>

         <p>March 31, 2014 [Tabular figures in thousands of dollars]</p>  <h5 id="note1">1. Authority and purpose</h5>  <p>The Passport Canada Revolving Fund [the “Fund”] was established in 1969 to provide for the issue of appropriate passport and other travel document services in Canada and at posts abroad. The <em>Revolving Funds Act</em> authorized the operation of the Fund.</p>  <p>Effective July 2, 2013, the accountability for the Passport Program and the Fund shifted from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development [DFATD] to Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC]. In addition, the Fund transferred its passport delivery and processing services to Employment and Social Development Canada [ESDC] on July 2, 2013.</p>  <p>The Fund has a continuing non-lapsing authority from Parliament to make payments out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for working capital, capital acquisitions and temporary financing of accumulated operating deficits.</p>  <p>Through the 2013–2014 Supplementary Estimates C, the drawdown authority was decreased from $131,204,000 to $1.</p>  <h5 id="note2">2. Significant accounting policies</h5>  <h6>Basis of accounting</h6>  <p>These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the significant accounting policies set out below to comply with the requirements of Section 4 of the Treasury Board of Canada <em>Policy on Special Revenue Spending Authorities </em>and the reporting requirements for revolving funds prescribed by the Receiver General for Canada. The basis of accounting used in these financial statements differs from Canadian generally accepted accounting principles because:</p>  <ul>

         <p>The capital projects are assets under construction which are not yet amortized; these capital assets will be amortized once they are in service. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight - line basis on the lesser of the remaining term of the lease or estimated useful life of the improvement.</p>  <h6>Employee termination benefits</h6>  <p>Employees of the Fund are entitled to specified termination benefits, calculated based on salary levels in effect at the time&nbsp;of termination as provided for under collective &nbsp;agreements and conditions of employment. The cost of these benefits is recorded in the accounts as the benefits accrue to the employees. The obligation relating to the benefits earned by employees is calculated using information derived from results of the actuarially determined liability for employee’s termination benefits for the government as a whole and is provided by Treasury Board of Canada. Effective July 2, 2013, the employee termination benefits liability relating to approximately 1,900 positions was transferred to ESDC.</p>  <h6>Pension plan</h6>  <p>Employees of the Fund are covered by the Public Service Retirement Pension Plan [the “Plan”] administered by the Government of Canada. Under present legislation, contributions made by the Fund to the Plan are limited to an amount equal to the employee’s contributions on account of current service. These contributions represent the total pension obligations of the Fund and are charged to operations on a current basis. The Fund is not required under present legislation to make contributions with respect to actuarial deficiencies of the Public Service Superannuation Account and/or with respect to charges to the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the indexation of payments under the <em>Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act</em>.</p>  <h6>Use of estimates</h6>  <p>The preparation of financial statements requires management and the Treasury Board Secretariat to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant areas requiring the use of estimates relate to employee termination benefits and to accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These estimates are reviewed annually and as adjustments become necessary, they are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they become known.</p>  <h6>Financial instruments</h6>  <p>The Fund’s financial instruments consist of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and employee termination benefits. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair value because of their short terms to maturity. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the Fund is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risk arising from these financial instruments.</p>  <h5 id="note3">3.
