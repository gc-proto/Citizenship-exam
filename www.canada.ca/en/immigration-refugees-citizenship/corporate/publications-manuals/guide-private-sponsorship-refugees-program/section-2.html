</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The PSR program is strictly for sponsoring refugees and persons in refugee-like situations. Under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/"><em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations</em></a>, there are two classes of persons who may qualify as refugees for Canada’s refugee and humanitarian resettlement program. The classes are the Convention Refugees Abroad Class and the Country of Asylum Class.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <dl class="dl-horizontal"> 
 <dt>
   Convention refugee: 
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <p>Any person who by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or</li> 
   <li>does not have a country of nationality, is outside the country of his or her former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.</li> 
  </ul> 
 </dd> 
 <dt>
   Convention Refugee Abroad: 
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <p>Any person who:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>is a Convention refugee;</li> 
   <li>is outside Canada;</li> 
   <li>is seeking resettlement in Canada;</li> 
   <li>does not have a prospect of another durable solution, within a reasonable period of time, that is: 
    <ul> 
     <li>cannot return to his or her country of nationality or habitual residence;</li> 
     <li>cannot integrate in the country of refuge or the country of first asylum; and</li> 
     <li>does not have another offer of resettlement from a country other than Canada.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li>will be privately sponsored or assisted by the government or has adequate financial resources to support himself or herself and any dependants.</li> 
  </ul> 
 </dd> 
 <dt>
   Member of the Country of Asylum Class: 
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <p>A person:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>who is outside his or her country of citizenship or habitual residence;</li> 
   <li>who has been, and continues to be, seriously and personally affected by civil war or armed conflict or who has suffered massive violations of human rights;</li> 
   <li>for whom there is no possibility of finding an adequate solution to his or her situation within a reasonable period of time; and</li> 
   <li>who will be privately sponsored or who has adequate financial resources to support himself or herself and any dependants.</li> 
  </ul> 
 </dd> 
</dl>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>An officer at a Canadian visa office makes the final decision on whether someone meets one of these definitions and is, therefore, eligible for resettlement. The eligibility decision is normally based on an interview with the applicant, supporting documentation submitted by the applicant and sponsoring group and additional information available to the officer (such as country condition updates).</p>  <p>To be accepted for resettlement in Canada, the refugee must also pass medical, security and admissibility checks. In addition, refugees will be assessed on their ability to establish successfully in Canada. In making this assessment, the visa officer will consider whether the refugee has relatives or a sponsor in Canada, the ability to speak or learn to speak English or French, the potential for employment and resourcefulness. When a family unit is applying, the settlement potential of all family members is assessed as a single determination. Refugees deemed by the visa officer to be in urgent need of protection or in vulnerable circumstances are not assessed on their ability to establish.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The following groups may submit a private sponsorship:</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <dl class="dl-horizontal"> 
 <dt>
   Sponsorship Agreement Holders (SAHs): 
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <p>Incorporated organizations that have signed a formal sponsorship agreement with Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Most current SAHs are religious organizations, ethnocultural groups or humanitarian organizations. SAHs, which may be local, regional or national, assume overall responsibility for the management of sponsorships under their agreement. Organizations entering into a sponsorship agreement with IRCC generally submit several refugee sponsorships a year.</p> 
 </dd> 
 <dt>
   Constituent Groups (CGs): 
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <p>A SAH can authorize CGs to sponsor under its agreement and provide support to the refugees. Each SAH sets its own criteria for recognizing CGs. CGs are based in the sponsored refugee's expected community of settlement and must have their sponsorship application and settlement plan approved by their SAH before the undertaking is submitted to the Resettlement Operations Centre in Ottawa (ROC-O).</p> 
 </dd> 
 <dt>
   Groups of Five (G5): 
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <p> Five or more Canadian citizens or permanent residents, who are at least 18 years of age, live in the expected community of settlement and have collectively arranged for the sponsorship of a refugee living abroad. The five individuals act as guarantors that the necessary support will be provided for the full duration of the sponsorship. ROC-O assesses individual contributions of group members to the sponsorship. The financial and non-financial aspects are considered collectively, as well as the settlement plan, before the sponsorship is approved. The group’s financial commitment must meet the levels established in the Sponsorship Cost Table under section E of the <a href="../../../../../content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5373ae.pdf">Settlement Plan (IMM&nbsp;5373AE)<span data-aem-details="filedetails"> (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 1.21<abbr title="Megabyte">MB</abbr>)</span></a>. </p> 
  <p>As part of the application package, the sponsoring group will need to include proof that each applicant has been recognized as a refugee by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) or by a foreign state. Only a photocopy of the original document is required. If the document is in a language other than English or French, then a certified translation (in either official language) must be submitted along with the photocopy of the original document.</p> 
 </dd> 
 <dt>
   Community Sponsors (CSs): 
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <p>Any organization (for-profit/not-for-profit, incorporated/non-incorporated) located in the community where the refugees are expected to settle can make an organizational commitment to sponsor. Community Sponsors must undergo financial and settlement plan assessments by ROC-O each time they wish to sponsor. Like G5s, Community Sponsors must demonstrate that the organization is willing and able to commit funds toward the sponsorship in line with the levels established in the Sponsorship Cost Table under section E of the <a href="../../../../../content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5515e.pdf">Settlement Plan and Financial Assessment (IMM 5515)<span data-aem-details="filedetails"> (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 1.28<abbr title="Megabyte">MB</abbr>)</span></a>.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p> A SAH, a CG or a CS has the option of formalizing a partnership with an outside party to share in the delivery of settlement assistance and support. Partnerships may be formed with individuals (e.g.,&nbsp;a family member of the sponsored refugee living in Canada) or other organizations. The partner–co-sponsor–is expected to sign the sponsorship undertaking and discharge the responsibilities that were agreed to in the settlement plan.</p>

<p>SAHs must be incorporated organizations. Generally, new SAH applicants have sponsorship experience and expect to sponsor multiple refugee cases each year.

        <h2 id="a2.6">2.6 What are the responsibilities of the sponsoring group?</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Sponsoring groups agree to provide the refugees with care, lodging, settlement assistance and support for the duration of the sponsorship period. Normally, this is 12&nbsp;months starting from the refugee's arrival in Canada or until the refugee becomes self-sufficient, whichever comes first. In exceptional circumstances, the visa officer may determine that the refugee requires more time to become established in Canada and will ask the sponsoring group to extend the sponsorship period to a maximum of 36&nbsp;months. The sponsoring group has the option of refusing the request for an extension of the sponsorship period. However, the sponsoring group risks having the case refused as a result.</p>  <p>Private sponsors normally support the sponsored refugees by:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>providing the cost of food, rent and household utilities and other day-to-day living expenses;</li> 
 <li>providing clothing, furniture and other household goods;</li> 
 <li>locating interpreters;</li> 
 <li>selecting a family physician and dentist;</li> 
 <li>assisting with applying for provincial health-care coverage;</li> 
 <li>enrolling children in school and adults in language training;</li> 
 <li>introducing newcomers to people with similar personal interests;</li> 
 <li>providing orientation with regard to banking services, transportation, etc.; and</li> 
 <li>helping in the search for employment.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Sponsoring groups must reside or have representatives in the community of settlement (i.e. in the community where the sponsored refugees will live). The intent is to have a group of persons helping refugees to get established in the community and not one person acting alone.</p>  <p>It is not possible to sponsor only one member of a family unit. The sponsorship undertaking should name all immediate and dependent family members listed on the <em>Application for Permanent Residence</em>, whether they are accompanying the principal applicant to Canada or may follow later under the provisions of the One Year Window (OYW) program as described in <a href="#a2.10">section&nbsp;2.10</a>. The sponsoring group is obliged to provide support to all family members listed on the undertaking, regardless of the timing of their arrival in Canada. The sponsor is responsible for supporting the non-accompanying family members under the same terms as in the original settlement plan, unless the principal refugee applicant is now self-sufficient and able to provide adequately for his or her family members. De facto dependants should also be included in the sponsorship but should be named on a separate undertaking as described in <a href="#a2.11">section&nbsp;2.11</a>.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="a2.7">2.7 How much financial support will be required?</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>The sponsorship application kit provides details of how much financial support will likely be needed to meet the sponsorship obligations as well as advice on how to determine whether a group has sufficient funds.</p>
<p>Although the cost of living varies across Canada, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5413-private-sponsorship-refugees-application-guide.html#appa">Sponsorship Cost Table and the In-Kind Deduction Table</a> included in Appendix A of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5413-private-sponsorship-refugees-application-guide.html#appa">Private Sponsorship of Refugees Application Guide</a> (IMM 5413) can help to estimate the minimum annual settlement cost for sponsoring a refugee or refugee family. The sponsorship cost table should be used as a guideline only as it is one national average of costs and there are several variances that can affect the amount of support required for sponsorship.</p>
<p>To determine the actual amount of financial assistance that may be required in a particular city or province, sponsors should consider the prevailing Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) rates in the expected community of settlement. Sponsors can email the PSR mailbox (<a href="mailto:IRCC.INPSR-PPPRRI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca">IRCC.INPSR-PPPRRI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca</a>) to ask about RAP rates in each province. However, sponsors should also consider other RAP and/or provincial/municipal social-economic benefits over and above the sponsorship cost table, such as (but not limited to) transportation allowance and/or health-related expenses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The total sponsorship costs may be reduced through the donation of &quot;in-kind&quot; goods, which may include shelter, furniture and clothing (refer to the in-kind deduction table in Appendix A of the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Application Guide (IMM&nbsp;5413)).</p>
<p>To assess financial capacity of a sponsoring group, ROC-O must be satisfied that the total amount of committed funds plus in-kind donations meets or exceeds the sponsorship cost table amounts after existing financial commitments of the sponsor(s) are taken into account. Existing financial commitments include other active sponsorships and the number of family members for which the sponsor is currently responsible for supporting in Canada.</p>
<p>The financial support of sponsors is given on the basis of need. Refugees are expected to contribute to their own settlement costs from funds they bring to Canada or earn during their sponsorship period.&nbsp; When the refugees have financial resources, they will retain the right to manage their own finances.&nbsp; Sponsors will not require the refugee(s) to submit their funds for management by others.</p>
<p>The standards for use of personal funds and earned income will follow the same standards as per the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP), e.g., calculation of income support and personal assets, additional income incentive threshold, Canada Child Benefit, etc., however the sponsor may choose to maintain a higher level of income support.</p>
<p>The sponsoring group may establish a trust fund for the sponsorship but may not accept or require payment of funds from a refugee for submitting a sponsorship.&nbsp; In the event that the refugee is not accepted for resettlement in Canada, funds held in trust for the sponsorship of that refugee, including all accumulated interest, must be returned to the donor.</p>
<p>Since sponsorship is meant to lead to self-sufficiency, sponsoring groups are encouraged to help refugees find employment but cannot force refugees to accept any job offered. Finding employment within the sponsorship period is not always possible, so the sponsoring group is advised not to count on employment income when securing funds for the sponsorship.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="a2.8">2.8 Are there any extra costs?</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>As stated in section 2.7, there may be unforeseen costs that occur post-arrival or additional costs based on the varying cost of living rates. The Sponsorship Cost Table should be used as a guideline only and not a fixed amount to use for budgeting purposes. Actual required costs may exceed sponsorship cost table amounts.</p>  <p>Refugees are usually given a loan from the Government of Canada to pay their transportation to Canada. In cases where the visa office has concerns about a refugee's ability to repay a loan, the sponsoring group may be asked to pay a portion of, or all these costs. Examples may be sponsorships for elderly persons who are unlikely to enter the labour market or sponsorships of unaccompanied minor children.</p>  <p>Payment for transportation and other costs from the contributions fund is reserved for certain cases within the Joint Assistance Sponsorship (JAS) component (see <a href="section-3.html">Additional Sponsorship Opportunities</a>) where a visa officer is of the opinion that the refugee would be unable to repay the loan.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="a2.9">2.9 How is a match made between a sponsoring group and a refugee?</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>There are two ways to match a sponsoring group and a refugee.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>1) Sponsor-referred</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The sponsoring group suggests the name of a refugee or refugee family it is interested in sponsoring. The group may have obtained the referral from an overseas contact, a friend, the relative of a member of the organization or elsewhere. SAHs/CGs, G5s and CSs submit the sponsorship application on behalf of the sponsor-referred refugee to ROC-O.</p>  <p>A group that would like to refer a refugee applicant for sponsorship should:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>consider whether or not the person is likely to be eligible for the private sponsorship program. (See <a href="#a2.1">Who may be sponsored?</a> and <a href="#a2.2">Who may not be sponsored?</a>) Ineligible applicants will be refused;</li> 
 <li>determine whether the person has relatives or friends in Canada. In most cases, refugees should be resettled in their relative's community.</li> 
</ul>  <p>To be sponsored as a refugee by a <strong>Group of Five</strong> or a <strong>Community Sponsor</strong>, the principal applicant <strong>must already have refugee status</strong>. Having refugee status means that an authorized body has determined that an individual meets its refugee definition. This authorized body can be the UNHCR or the government of the country where the asylum seeker is currently living (i.e., foreign state).</p>  <p>A document proving recognized refugee status that has been issued by the UNHCR or a foreign state must accompany the refugee sponsorship application submitted to <span class="nowrap">ROC-O</span>. </p>  <p>Principal Applicants without refugee status recognized by the UNHCR or a foreign state can only be sponsored by a Sponsorship Agreement Holder (SAH). A <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/private-sponsorship-program/agreement-holders/holders-list.html">list of the SAHs</a> in Canada is updated regularly to reflect all groups/organizations which have signed sponsorship agreements with the Government of Canada.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>2) Visa office-referred</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>ROC-O at IRCC national headquarters in Ottawa administers an inventory of visa office-referred (VOR) cases that have already been selected but for which IRCC works to find a private sponsor to match with the refugee identified initially by the UNHCR. VOR cases are normally ready to travel to Canada within one to four months of being matched with a sponsor. However, delays may occur in some travel-ready cases because of problems in arranging exit permits, travel documents, etc. Once the sponsorship is signed, the local IRCC Centre works with ROC-O and the visa office to provide the sponsor with more accurate information regarding departure and arrival dates, as well as any particular settlement needs that might exist in transit and in the first few weeks after the refugees have arrived in Canada.</p>  <p>Please refer to <a href="section-3.html">section 3. Additional Sponsorship Opportunities</a> for more information on VORs, including the Blended VOR (BVOR) program.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="a2.10">2.10 What is a non-accompanying family member and the One-Year Window (OYW) of Opportunity?</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>Non-accompanying family members are spouses and dependent children of the principal applicant who have been separated from the family unit and will not be travelling with the rest of the family. De facto dependants (see definition in <a href="#a2.11">section 2.11</a>) cannot be identified as non-accompanying family members.</p> 
<p>If the separated family member’s application for permanent residence is submitted to ROC-O within one year of the principal applicant’s arrival in Canada, it will be processed on an expedited basis as part of the same application. In order to qualify, the principal applicant must identify the non-accompanying family member on the <a href="../../../../../content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm0008enu_2d.pdf">Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM&nbsp;0008)<span data-aem-details="filedetails"> (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 553.83<abbr title="Kilobyte">KB</abbr>)</span></a> before departing for Canada. If the application is submitted after the one-year period has expired, the family member will not benefit from the provisions of the OYW. Applications for consideration under the OYW of opportunity are processed at the visa office responsible for the area in which the family members reside, even if that differs from the visa office where the principal applicant was processed.</p> 
<p>Sponsoring groups must include separated family members on the undertaking and also ensure that the principal applicant identifies them on the IMM&nbsp;0008 application as non-accompanying family members. <strong>Family members who are not identified on the IMM&nbsp;008 application form will not be eligible for the OYW or for sponsorship under the Family Class at a later date</strong>.</p> 
<p>When a non-accompanying family member is located or otherwise becomes available for processing, the family member in Canada or their sponsoring group will submit a OYW application to ROC-O.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>A de facto dependant is a person considered by the refugee family to be an integral member of the family unit, but who does not meet IRCC’s definition of a family member. For example, an elderly aunt who has always lived with the principal applicant may be a de facto dependant. Such individuals should be included in the sponsorship.</p>  <p>To be considered as a member of the family unit, such individuals must satisfy the visa officer that they are dependent on the family unit in which membership is claimed. The dependency may be emotional or economic and will often be a combination of the two. Such people would normally, but not exclusively, live with the principal applicant as members of the same household.</p>  <p>Sponsors must submit a separate sponsorship undertaking for de facto dependants. They should, however, identify the name and date of birth of the principal applicant in the Multiple Undertakings section of the undertaking to ensure that de facto dependants and the rest of the family unit are processed concurrently.</p>  <p>De facto dependants must be refugees in their own right and meet all statutory requirements. Where the de facto dependant does not qualify as a refugee in their own right, they may be eligible for humanitarian and compassionate consideration. Persons who form part of the family unit will be examined while keeping in mind the goal of keeping family units together.</p>  <p>De facto dependants must also complete separate applications. In addition, Schedule&nbsp;2 of the overseas refugee application kit (<a href="../../../services/application/application-forms-guides/applying-convention-refugee-humanitarian-protected-person-abroad.html">Application for Convention Refugees Abroad and Humanitarian-protected Persons Abroad IMM&nbsp;6000</a>) includes a section in which the principal applicant is asked to identify the de facto dependants who are co-applying.</p>  <p>For all VOR cases and cases where the sponsor did not list de facto dependants identified by the principal applicant, visa officers will contact ROC-O to ensure that sponsoring groups are prepared to assume responsibility for the settlement of the de facto dependants with the rest of the family unit.</p>  <p>De facto dependants are <strong>not</strong> eligible under the OYW as they do not meet the definition of family member described above.</p>

 <li>A widowed sister or sister-in-law in a culture where it is normal for the applicant to take on responsibility for her care and sustenance when she has no other means of support.</li> 
 <li>Nieces and nephews whose parents have been killed or are missing. In the case of nieces and nephews, sponsors must take into consideration the best interests of the child. To the extent possible, sponsors should work with appropriate authorities in that field to try to avoid any disputes with respect to custody or guardianship.</li> 
 <li>Parents of any age living with the principal applicant and without other children with whom they could reside or without means of support other than the principal applicant.</li>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Sponsoring groups may provide additional information to the visa office in support of the applicant's need for protection. Information provided should generally be non-personal and written by organizations or individuals who are aware of the current situation in the country the applicant is fleeing or now residing in.</p>  <p>Examples of information that can help the visa officer in making a determination on the applicant's need for protection include written accounts from individuals who have fled similar situations, recent media reports on the persecution of persons with similar attributes, and reports of government legislation affecting the status of refugees in countries of asylum. Supporting information must be directly relevant to the refugee's need for protection.</p>  <p>Sponsoring groups are further encouraged to include their settlement plan for refugees who they feel may be considered difficult to settle. This is intended to inform the visa office that the sponsoring group is prepared to cope with any special needs the refugees may have.</p>  <p>If sponsoring groups wish to provide a Sponsorship Rationale, a separate sheet of paper may be attached to the application to provide additional information as to why:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>the principal refugee applicant is being referred for protection;</li> 
 <li>resettlement is the only durable solution available to him/her; and</li> 
 <li>Canada is the most logical choice as a destination.</li> 
</ul>  <p>This section can assist sponsors in screening their applications so that they can determine, to the best of their knowledge, whether the applicant meets one of the definitions of refugee. Ultimately, the final decision on whether an applicant is both eligible and admissible rests with the visa officer.</p>  <p>The submission of supporting information is optional and designed to help sponsors show why the person is in need of resettlement and what arrangements have been made in Canada to help the refugee settle.</p>

        <h2 id="a2.15">2.15 How to submit a sponsorship application via email</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>You can now submit a sponsorship application via email to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Please follow these instructions to ensure that your application is processed without delays.</p>  <p> When compared with receiving applications via regular mail, this new process allows ROC-O to save more than one hour in processing time per application and it allows the sponsors to receive an email auto-reply to confirm proper reception right away.</p>  <p> To properly submit an email sponsorship application, here are a few tips:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Your scanner must be set at a high resolution (at least 400 DPI). If the documents sent are not legible, ROC-O will not accept your application. Note that if you decide to re-submit your application, you must resubmit it in its entirety, not just the documents that were not legible.</li> 
 <li>Applications can be submitted in black and white.</li> 
 <li>Do not submit ZIP files as ROC-O cannot open these types of files. If you do, ROC-O will not accept your application.</li> 
 <li>When you submit an application via email, do not submit a duplicate application via postal mail. This causes confusion and will delay processing. For SAHs, this will also affect the accuracy of your available cap spaces.</li> 
 <li>The IMM0008 submitted must be 2D bar-coded. A single 2D barcode can hold a significant amount of information and may be printed easily. If the IMM0008 submitted is not 2D bar-coded (or if the 2D bar coded page of the IMM0008 is missing), ROC-O will not accept your application. Using a 2D bar coded form saves ROC-O up to 45 minutes in processing time. 
  <ul> 
   <li>When you enter the information on the online IMM0008 form, it must comply with a specific format and certain fields must be completed in order to “validate” the form. If mandatory fields are not completed and you click “validate”, those fields will be identified in red. Once the form is complete and you click “Validate”, a 2D bar code is created. Validation does not mean that the form is submitted to ROC-O directly. It only means that a 2D bar code will be generated to be printed as part of the IMM0008 form. Upon receipt of an application, ROC-O will scan the bars on the IMM0008. Once scanned, the validated information will be uploaded directly in the Global Case Management System (GCMS).</li> 
   <li>As you often receive the IMM0008 in two parts, i.e. the form itself and then the signature page, you have two options to submit the form (note: the second option provides the best results for the barcodes): 
    <ul> 
     <li>Validate the IMM0008 by clicking the “validate” button on the IMM0008</li> 
     <li>Print the validated IMM0008</li> 
     <li>Discard the empty signature page and replace it with the signed page</li> 
     <li>Scan the validated IMM0008 with the signed signature page</li> 
     <li>Submit to ROC-O. <p>Or</p> </li> 
     <li>Validate the IMM0008 by clicking the “validate” button on the IMM0008, save the PDF and attach it to your email. The attachment should be titled: “IMM008 – validated”</li> 
     <li>Scan separately the signature page, scan it and attach it to your email. The attachment should be titled: “IMM008 – signature page”</li> 
     <li>Submit to ROC-O.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li>All forms MUST be typed.</li> 
 <li>To facilitate the receipt and identification of applications emailed to ROC-O, you must submit your application in six separate email attachments within the one or more emails (depending on the size of the attachments). For the item “supporting documentation”, you can submit multiple attachments as needed. Please use the following naming conventions for your attachments: 
  <ol> 
   <li>Sponsor documents. Name this file: “PA LAST NAME, First Name - Sponsor documents”</li> 
   <li>IMM0008 &amp; IMM0008 DEP (if applicable). Name this file: “PA LAST NAME, First Name - IMM0008”</li> 
   <li>Schedule A, Schedule 2, &amp; Use of Representative forms. Name this file: “PA LAST NAME, First Name - Schedules”</li> 
   <li>Refugee photos. 1 photo per applicant. Name this file: “PA LAST NAME, First Name Refugee - Photos”</li> 
   <li>Passports. Name this file: “PA LAST NAME, First Name - Passports”</li> 
   <li>Supporting documentation. Name this file: “PA LAST NAME, First Name - Supporting documentation”</li> 
  </ol> </li> 
 <li>Your overall email (text and attachments) cannot be bigger than 10MB. If your email is bigger than 10MB, it will bounce back and you will NOT receive an email auto-reply from ROC-O.</li> 
 <li>If any individual attachment in your email is bigger than 5MB, the email will be received at ROC-O (an auto reply will be sent), but the application will be returned to you as incomplete.</li> 
 <li>Your subject line for your email must follow the following structure: PA LAST NAME, first name – sponsorship application. If your email exceeds 10 MB, you must send your application in multiple emails. To ensure that ROC-O can find all the emails for your application, please use the following subject lines: 
  <ul> 
   <li>For the first email: Part 1 of 2: PA LAST NAME, first name – sponsorship application</li> 
   <li>For the second email:Part 2 of 2: PA LAST NAME, first name – sponsorship application, etc.</li> 
   <li>Note that you will receive an auto-reply (see Annex B) for each email sent.</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li>If your application has been received by ROC-O but is incomplete, ROC-O will not open a file. If you decide to re-submit your application, you MUST resubmit it in its entirety. You cannot only submit the missing documents.</li> 
 <li>As part of the application process, you must submit photos for each of the applicants included in your sponsorship application. You only have to submit one photo for each applicant. The photo should respect the following specifications:</li>

 <li>notify the sponsor when a selection decision has been made;</li> 
 <li>conduct an interview to determine if the applicant is a member of the Convention Refugees Abroad Class or Country of Asylum Class;</li> 
 <li>assess the applicant's ability to establish in Canada;</li> 
 <li>initiate medical, criminal and security checks and review the results to ensure the applicant is admissible to Canada;</li> 
 <li><strong>for all VOR sponsorships:</strong> send a completed VOR referral form&nbsp;1 to ROC-O so that the profile can be added to the online refugee profile directory;</li> 
 <li>issue a loan for transportation;</li> 
 <li>issue a permanent resident visa when a positive final decision is made;</li> 
 <li>make travel arrangements for the refugee in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration (if applicable);</li> 
 <li>provide the refugee with orientation and travel information in collaboration with international service providers; and</li> 
 <li>advise ROC-O of the date and place that the refugees will arrive in Canada.</li> 
</ul>  <p>The applicable <strong>local IRCC office</strong> in Canada will:</p>  <ul>

 <li> <p>An Acknowledgment of Receipt (AOR) letter will be sent to the sponsor once the application has been received, and another will be sent after the application has been verified for completeness and the file is created. This letter will include the IRCC file number (G&nbsp;number), which the sponsor can use to check the status of the application in the <a href="https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/%3Bjsessionid=8AD5D103FCE5ABF1A71862D53A606EA4?app=ecas&amp;lang=en">Electronic Client Application System</a> (E-CAS).</p> <p>Incomplete applications will be returned to the party (either the sponsor or the refugee) that submitted it.</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>An approval or refusal letter will be sent to the sponsor once an officer has reviewed the Sponsorship Undertaking and rendered a decision. This letter will include a link where sponsors can find processing times for their applications overseas.</p> </li> 
</ol>  <p>Sponsorship groups may submit application status enquiries by emailing: <a href="mailto:IRCC.INROCO-CORORI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca">IRCC.INROCO-CORORI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca</a> only when the: </p>  <ul>

Processing times in each visa office for the past 12 months are <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/perm/ref-private.asp">available online</a>.

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Depending on the province of destination, the waiting period for provincial health insurance coverage can be as much as 90&nbsp;days for new permanent residents. However, in most jurisdictions, resettled refugees may be eligible from the day of arrival. Privately sponsored refugees should apply for provincial or territorial health insurance as soon as possible.</p>  <p> The Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP) provides limited, temporary coverage of health-care benefits for specific groups of people in Canada until they become eligible for provincial or territorial health insurance. The IFHP is a payer of last resort, limiting benefits to those who lack public health insurance or comprehensive private insurance.</p>  <p> All resettled refugees, including privately sponsored refugees, are eligible for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/health-care/interim-federal-health-program/coverage-summary.html">basic, supplemental and prescription drug coverage</a> under the IFHP. The duration of coverage is as follows:</p>  <ul> 
 <li><strong>Basic coverage</strong> (for example, doctor visits and hospital care) is provided until the beneficiary qualifies for provincial or territorial health insurance, which typically occurs within <strong>3&nbsp;months</strong>.</li> 
 <li><strong>Supplemental and prescription drug coverage</strong> is provided until the beneficiary is no longer under private sponsorship. In most cases, <strong>coverage is valid for 12&nbsp;months</strong> from the date that the resettled refugee arrives in Canada.</li> 
</ul>  <p>Read <a href="../../../services/refugees/help-within-canada/health-care.html">details about the IFHP</a>, including how to apply and the description of coverage.</p>

         <p>Some groups establish trust accounts for the funds collected, raised or donated for the settlement of sponsored refugees. IRCC neither promotes nor objects to the use of trust accounts. However, groups should use caution in ensuring that the funds in the account and all interest accrued are <strong>used only for the direct settlement costs of the refugees</strong> for whom the funds were collected. Groups must be able to account for all expenditures. To ensure this, the account can be registered in the name of the sponsoring group with a note specifying that the money is in trust for the sponsored refugee. For withdrawals, the account should require the signature of at least two group members.</p>

These cards are valid for five&nbsp;years. To receive their PR cards, permanent residents must provide their new mailing address in Canada.

        <h3>Secondary migration and self-destination</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Sponsors are encouraged to maintain open lines of communication with both the refugee and ROC-O throughout the sponsorship period.</p>  <p> It may happen that, at some point during the sponsorship period, the refugee either fails to establish in or decides to move out of the sponsor's community. This is referred to as self-destination or secondary migration. If this happens to a group sponsoring under a SAH, the group is advised to discuss the situation with the&nbsp;SAH.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <ul> 
 <li>If the refugee is able to support himself or herself in the new community for the remainder of the sponsorship period, the sponsoring group has no further obligations.</li> 
 <li>If the sponsoring group wishes to transfer the sponsorship to another group in the new community or if the group is not willing or able to continue providing material assistance to the refugee in the new location, ROC-O must be contacted immediately. (Note: If the former, the SAH is expected to make the initial contact with another sponsoring group.)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In a transfer of sponsorship, the new group signs a sponsorship undertaking for the remainder of the sponsorship period. The new undertaking replaces the first and the original group is no longer considered the sponsor. Where the sponsor has decided that it will not or cannot continue to support the refugee in the new community, the sponsorship is in danger of breakdown.</p> 
<p> In this case, the local IRCC Centre, the sponsoring group (including the SAH if a CG is involved) and the refugee will meet to try to resolve the sponsorship breakdown and, if applicable, to ascertain responsibility. The three-way meeting will also address the ongoing needs of the refugee for the remainder of the sponsorship period and the capacity of the sponsor to support the refugee under the changed circumstances. Where there is no agreement on who is ultimately responsible for the breakdown, the local IRCC Centre makes the final determination. If the sponsor is found responsible, the group must continue to support the refugee in the new community. If it is not responsible, it is released from all further obligations.</p> 
<p> It is important to remember that unless the local IRCC Centre issues a formal notice of sponsorship breakdown, (which effectively cancels the sponsorship undertaking) sponsored refugees are <strong>not</strong> entitled to obtain income support through provincial or municipal social assistance programs or the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) during the sponsorship period (normally 12&nbsp;months).</p> 
<p>Furthermore, sponsoring groups may, under certain circumstances, be liable for reimbursing the government concerned for income support issued to refugees under the group's sponsorship. For more information on sponsorship breakdown, consult <a href="../../../../../content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/ip/ip03-part4-eng.pdf">Chapter&nbsp;3 of IRCC's in-Canada processing manual (IP&nbsp;3)<span data-aem-details="filedetails"> (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 235.29<abbr title="Kilobyte">KB</abbr>)</span></a> or the <a href="../../../services/refugees/help-outside-canada/private-sponsorship-program/agreement-holders.html">Sponsorship Agreement</a>.</p>

        <h3>Sponsorship Withdrawals</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p> Sponsorship withdrawal is the cancellation of a sponsorship undertaking before the permanent residence visa has been issued. It is the last option when all other attempts to fulfil the conditions of the sponsorship have failed or when situations have changed.</p> 
<p> Sponsoring groups may not withdraw an undertaking after a visa has been issued. In such cases, sponsorship dispute and breakdown protocols would be initiated following the applicant's arrival in Canada.</p> 
<p>Sponsorship withdrawal requests must be sent to ROC-O and must include the reason(s) for requesting a withdrawal.</p> 
<p>In cases of withdrawal, sponsors are expected to locate a new sponsoring group if feasible. Examples of where it is not feasible to locate a new sponsorship group include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>the refugee having found another durable solution;</li> 
 <li>new personal information being gained about the refugee that makes the sponsorship no longer viable; or</li> 
 <li>the refugee having made no contact with the visa office to return requested information or to respond to subsequent efforts by the visa office to contact the refugee.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In cases where a sponsor is still required, the original sponsor must inform ROC-O in writing, whether or not a new sponsorship group could be located. If a new sponsorship group could not be located, the refugee's application will likely be refused.</p> 
<p> Requests for withdrawal that are determined to be unacceptable may have negative consequences on future sponsorship activities of the organization. Depending on the circumstances and reasons for the withdrawal, sponsorship agreements can be either suspended or cancelled. Withdrawals that are determined not to have been the fault of the SAH will not result in suspension or cancellation of the Sponsorship Agreement.</p> 
<p>For more information on sponsorship withdrawal, consult <a href="../../../../../content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/ip/ip03-part4-eng.pdf">Chapter&nbsp;3 of IRCC's in-Canada processing manual (IP&nbsp;3)<span data-aem-details="filedetails"> (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 235.29<abbr title="Kilobyte">KB</abbr>)</span></a> or the <a href="../../../services/refugees/help-outside-canada/private-sponsorship-program/agreement-holders.html">Sponsorship Agreement</a> both of which are available on the IRCC website.</p>
