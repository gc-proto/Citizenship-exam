         <p>I am pleased to present the 2015–2016 <em>Report on Plans and Priorities</em> for Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). In the coming year, the Government of Canada will ensure the immigration system continues to help drive Canada’s growth and economic prosperity. The plans and priorities detailed in this year’s report support that goal, while also upholding our country’s great humanitarian and family reunification traditions.</p>  <p>In 2015, we plan to welcome between 260,000 and 285,000 new permanent residents to Canada. This is a notable increase from the annual planning range of 240,000 to 265,000, in place since 2007. It represents the highest planned level of admissions in recent Canadian history, and will make it easier for us to maintain all of our immigration streams while continuing our significant progress on reducing backlogs and wait times throughout the immigration system. Almost 65% of overall admissions this year will be in the economic immigration class, an increase of two per cent over last year’s planned levels. The remaining 35% of admissions will be in the family reunification and humanitarian categories, including refugees.</p>  <p>The introduction of Express Entry on January 1, 2015, underlines the Government’s commitment to ensuring the immigration system supports a strong and prosperous Canada. This new approach to managing and processing applications in our economic immigration programs enables us to select immigrants based on the skills and attributes our country needs, and on criteria linked to immigrants’ economic success.</p>  <p>As we continue to support economic immigration, we will not lose sight of our obligation to protect the most vulnerable of newcomers, particularly immigrant women and children. Once implemented, the <em>Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act</em> tabled in November 2014 will strengthen our laws to protect Canadians and newcomers to Canada from harmful practices, including underage, forced and polygamous marriage, which deny gender equality and deprive individuals of their human rights.</p>  <p>We will also be increasing the number of caregivers becoming permanent residents to 30,000 in 2015, an all-time high in that category. Coupled with reforms introduced in 2014, including the elimination of the requirement to live in an employer’s home, the Caregiver Program will be better, faster and safer for caregivers seeking to make Canada their permanent home.</p>  <p>In the coming year, we will continue to improve our overseas integration and settlement services to ensure immigrants are best set for success and prepared to begin contributing to Canada before they arrive here. Proposals for pre-arrival services will continue to undergo evaluations.</p>  <p>With the passage into law in 2014 of the<em> Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act</em>, we will continue to benefit from the first comprehensive reforms to the <em>Citizenship Act</em> in more than a generation. In the coming year, these reforms will allow us to significantly reduce citizenship processing times, which will enable more qualified newcomers to become citizens.</p>  <p>We will continue to work with our international partners, especially the United States, to ensure the safety and security of our borders, while improving efficiencies and ease of travel for legitimate visitors to Canada. Under the <em>Beyond the Border</em> <em>Action Plan</em>, we will oversee the implementation of the Electronic Travel Authorization program, an easy and quick application process for visa-exempt air travellers from countries other than the United States.</p>  <p>As Canada’s Citizenship and Immigration Minister, I present these plans with the conviction they will strengthen Canada’s economy, social cohesion, and national security. The success of our programs depends on the hard work and commitment of CIC’s staff. I would like to thank them for their outstanding service to the citizens, and potential future citizens, of our country.<br> </p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>In the first years after Confederation, Canada’s leaders had a powerful vision: to connect Canada by rail and make the West the world’s breadbasket as a foundation for the country’s economic prosperity. This vision meant quickly populating the Prairies, leading the Government of Canada to establish its first national immigration policies. Immigrants have been a driving force in Canada’s nationhood and its economic prosperity—as farmers settling lands, as workers in factories fuelling industrial growth, as entrepreneurs and as innovators helping Canada to compete in the global, knowledge-based economy.</p>

         <p><a href="../../../../services/immigration-citizenship.html">Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)</a> selects foreign nationals as permanent and temporary residents and offers Canada’s protection to refugees. The Department develops Canada’s admissibility policy, which sets the conditions for entering and remaining in Canada; it also conducts, in collaboration with its partners, the screening of potential permanent and temporary residents to protect the health, safety and security of Canadians. Fundamentally, the Department builds a stronger Canada by helping immigrants and refugees settle and integrate into Canadian society and the economy, and by encouraging and facilitating Canadian citizenship. To achieve this, CIC&nbsp;operates 22 in-Canada points of service and 66 points of service in 58 countries.</p>  <p>CIC's broad mandate is partly derived from the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-29.4/index.html">Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act</a></em>. The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration Canada is responsible for the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-29/index.html">Citizenship Act</a></em> of 1977 and shares responsibility with the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness for the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/i-2.5/index.html">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a></em> (IRPA), which came into force following major legislative reform in 2002. CIC and the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/">Canada Border Services Agency</a> support their respective ministers in the administration and enforcement of IRPA. These organizations work collaboratively to achieve and balance the objectives of the immigration and refugee programs.</p>  <p>In October 2008, responsibility for administration of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-18.7"><em>Canadian Multiculturalism Act</em></a> was transferred to CIC from the <a href="http://www.pch.gc.ca/">Department of Canadian Heritage</a>. Under the Act, CIC promotes the integration of individuals and communities into all aspects of Canadian society and helps to build a stronger, more cohesive society.</p>  <p>In July 2013, the primary responsibility for the <a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=739609">Passport Program</a> was transferred from <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/international/index.aspx?lang=eng">Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD)</a> to CIC, while passport service delivery will be provided through <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/goc/passport.shtml">Service Canada</a>.</p>  <p>In August 2013, CIC assumed the responsibility for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/international-experience-canada-moving-citizenship-immigration-canada.html">International Experience Canada (IEC) – archived</a> from DFATD. This transfer allowed the program to better align with government priorities and labour market demands in Canada by linking IEC to other immigration programs.</p>  <p>Jurisdiction over immigration is a shared responsibility between the federal and the provincial and territorial governments under section 95 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-1.html"><em>Constitution Act</em>, <em>1867</em></a>.</p>

         <h5 id="managing_sig_pol">Managing a Significant Policy and Program Change Agenda</h5>  <p>CIC will work to help Canada remain economically competitive with other countries and attractive to potential immigrants by continuing to implement one of the most ambitious reform agendas in its history. CIC will create efficiencies and improve the client experience through a range of measures, beginning with implementation of the <a href="../../../services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a> application management system launched on January 1, 2015. CIC will work with delivery partners, such as the Canada Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to welcome between 260,000 and 285,000 permanent residents in 2015. This first notable increase in planned levels since 2007 will help address both current and projected labour shortages. Other initiatives include improved self-service options like integrated voice response, e-services and CIC’s updated Web site.</p>  <h5 id="safeguard_integrity">Safeguarding Integrity of Information/Data</h5>  <p>In 2015–2016, CIC will promote awareness of information and data risks to staff and provide training on information management and best practices for privacy. In addition, CIC will continue to implement stronger and better tools and processes for collecting, managing and storing information, and for sharing it both internally and externally.</p>  <h5 id="program_integrity">Maintaining program integrity in response to increasingly complex security risks</h5>  <p>Fraud prevention is an ongoing challenge in immigration and citizenship programs. As program integrity is strengthened, individuals will develop more sophisticated means of gaining illegal entry to Canada. CIC will continue to strengthen program integrity through improved information sharing, increased fraud-related penalties, and reduced inefficiencies in the processing system.</p>  <p>For example, on June 19, 2014, the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act (Bill C-24) came into force, reinforcing the value of citizenship by cracking down on fraud and ensuring Canadian citizenship is only offered to those who are qualified. Specific measures include stronger penalties for fraud and misrepresentation; expanding the grounds to bar an application for citizenship to include foreign criminality; and making it an offence for unauthorized individuals to knowingly represent or advise a person for a fee on a citizenship application or hearing.</p>  <h5 id="partnership_mgt">Depending on Partners to Support Delivery of Programs and Services</h5>  <p>The delivery of the immigration program is a shared jurisdiction between federal, provincial and territorial governments. The complexity of the immigration and settlement systems means that decisions made by CIC or any of its partners or stakeholders can significantly affect relationships, performance results and the ability to meet objectives for all stakeholders.</p>  <p>CIC will work closely with other federal departments and agencies, as well as third-party service provider organizations<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> and other public stakeholders to deliver the immigration program efficiently and effectively, including the continued use of joint governance structures, service standards, and reporting requirements.</p>  <h5 id="responding_cumulative"> Responding to cumulative natural disasters and emerging events </h5>  <p> Natural disasters and international crises can lead to unpredictable migration flows that may require Canada’s intervention and specialized support for resettlement. They can also lead to risks to the health and safety of Canadians or to the temporary closure of operational infrastructure. The Department will maintain and improve its emergency response and business continuity plans and procedures so that it can respond efficiently and effectively when emergencies arise. Based on recent experiences such as the Ebola virus crisis, CIC will review and develop flexible policies and procedures, to enable the Department to provide a timely and coordinated emergency response to unexpected world events that could affect CIC’s program delivery.</p>

This is due primarily to a reduction in funding for the return of fees for terminated applications, the impact of refugee reform as well as the completion of time-limited initiatives under the Beyond the Border Action Plan. From 2016–2017 to 2017–2018, planned spending increases by $6M and is mostly related to a combination of reduced revenues from passport program and a decrease in funding for the Beyond of Border initiative.</p>

         <p>Overall, the Department’s planned spending will be reduced from current levels to $1,394.3 million in 2017–2018. This decrease is largely due to declining statutory funding supporting the return of fees for terminated applications as announced in <a href="http://www.budget.gc.ca/2012/plan/pdf/Plan2012-eng.pdf">Economic Action Plan 2012</a>. </p>  <p>The negative amount in statutory spending is mostly explained by the anticipated surplus of the Passport Program. As this program is financed entirely from the fees charged for passports and other travel documents, its costs and revenues must balance out over its 10-year business cycle.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>CIC plays a significant role in fostering Canada’s economic development. By promoting Canada as a destination of choice for innovation, investment and opportunity, CIC encourages talented individuals to come to Canada and to contribute to our prosperity. Canada’s immigration program is based on non-discriminatory principles—foreign nationals are assessed without regard to race, nationality, ethnic origin, colour, religion or gender. Those who are selected to immigrate to Canada have the skills, education, language competencies and work experience to make an immediate economic contribution.</p>  <p>CIC’s efforts, whether through policy and program development or processing applications for the various programs, result in several hundred thousand new permanent residents each year. Under the 2008 amendments to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/index.html">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a></em> (IRPA), the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration Canada has the authority to issue instructions establishing priorities for processing certain categories of applications. In that regard, the Department analyses and monitors its programs to ensure they are responsive to emerging labour market needs.</p>  <p>Through policy and program development and processing applications, CIC’s temporary resident programs help meet Canada’s temporary labour market needs; facilitate global talent mobility and youth exchanges; attract and retain international students; and help enable trade, investment and tourism. </p>

        <h4>Benefits for Canadians</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Immigration continues to have a significant influence on Canadian society and economic development. Permanent residents who arrive in Canada every year enhance Canada’s social fabric, contribute to labour market growth and strengthen the economy. Changes that modernize and improve the immigration system not only strengthen the integrity of the Permanent Economic Residents Program but also benefit Canada by targeting skills Canadian employers need and admitting qualified individuals more quickly.</p>  <p>Temporary foreign workers help generate growth for a number of Canadian industries by meeting short-term and acute needs in the labour market that are not easily filled by the domestic labour force. International students contribute economically as consumers and enrich the fabric of Canadian society through their diverse experiences and talents. Some temporary workers and international students represent a key talent pool to be retained as immigrants.</p>

The goal of the program is to select highly skilled immigrants whose high human capital enables them to contribute to Canada’s long-term national and structural labour market needs, in support of a strong and prosperous Canadian economy. The program uses a points system to identify prospective immigrants with the ability to establish economically in Canada, based on their human capital (education, skilled work experience, language skills, etc.), with a minimum language threshold and a third-party foreign educational credential assessment prior to application. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>

Eligible applicants come to Canada as foreign nationals authorized for temporary work, subject to their employer obtaining a neutral or positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). The LMIA considers whether a Canadian or permanent resident is available and the wage and working conditions being offered. The critical component of the program distinguishing it from the general pool of foreign nationals authorized for temporary work is the requirement for the caregiver to reside in their place of employment. The program is also unique in that foreign workers arriving in Canada under the program are eligible to apply for permanent residence after two years or 3,900 hours of full-time employment within four years of their arrival in Canada. They are granted permanent residence as part of the live-in caregiver category of the Economic Class, with established room under the annual levels plan. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants. </p>

International students contribute to Canada’s educational and international competitiveness, and strengthen our educational institutions. International students are selected by Canadian institutions according to their respective criteria, and CIC authorizes their entry into Canada to study by approving study permits and, where necessary, visas, which allow them to obtain a Canadian education. CIC is responsible for ensuring that the proper documentation, financial and security requirements are met, including the bona fides of all applicants. In order to provide students with additional opportunities to obtain Canadian work experience, qualified international students are authorized to work either on or off-campus without a work permit, or as part of a co-op or internship program with a co-op work permit. Students who want to work in Canada after graduation can apply for a work permit under the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) component, which allows them to gain up to three years of Canadian work experience. Some PGWP holders will also be eligible to apply for permanent residence under the CEC or other programs.

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.1.2.2">Sub-Program 1.2.2: Temporary Work Authorization</h5>  <p>Foreign nationals can be authorized to work in Canada through various processes. Under situations that require an LMIA, employers are able to hire foreign workers as a last resort to meet their short-term or acute labour and skills needs when qualified Canadian citizens or permanent residents are not available, ensuring that Canadians have the first opportunity for jobs where appropriate. In order to hire a temporary foreign worker to respond to labour market shortages, employers require an LMIA from ESDC, which considers whether a Canadian or permanent resident is available, examines the wage and working conditions being offered, and assess whether the job offer would have a negative, neutral or positive effect on the Canadian labour market. Once the potential employer is in possession of the LMIA, the foreign national may then apply for the work permit at a mission abroad, at the port of entry (if eligible) or inside Canada (if eligible). In certain situations, employers can also seek to employ foreign nationals to work in Canada without an LMIA. Exemptions from the LMIA process are offered where they support broader Canadian interests such as the competitive advantages and reciprocal benefits that Canadians enjoy as a result of international agreements and partnerships (including <em>North America Free Trade Agreement</em> and others). Under these circumstances, the foreign national applies to CIC for a work permit overseas, at a port of entry (if eligible) or from inside Canada (if eligible). CIC’s role is to manage the authorization of foreign nationals to work in Canada. CIC ensures the foreign national meets all admissibility and eligibility requirements, and, when an LMIA is not required, considers the genuineness of the job offer, while also ensuring a robust operation is in place to enforce employer compliance with program requirements. The selection and processing involve the issuance of temporary resident visas and work permits to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.1.2.3">Sub-Program 1.2.3: International Experience Canada</h5>  <p>International Experience Canada (IEC) is a cultural exchange program that permits Canadians and foreign nationals, aged 18-35, to travel and work in other countries for six months to two years at a time. Foreign participants are issued work permits that are exempt from the requirement of an LMIA on the basis that their work in Canada creates or maintains reciprocal employment for Canadians in other countries. Some foreign participants will also be eligible to apply for permanent residence under the CEC or other programs, thereby contributing to Canada’s permanent economic immigration objectives. Young Canadian participants in other countries obtain foreign work experience, which benefits their future careers in the Canadian workplace and contributes to Canada’s international competitiveness. Exchanges with foreign countries contribute to national interests by strengthening Canada’s bilateral relations and supporting Canada’s economic and trade agenda. Most IEC exchanges occur through bilateral reciprocal Youth Mobility Agreements (YMAs) with other countries. CIC sets the maximum number of foreign national participants it will permit annually, and on an annual basis negotiates bilateral quotas with each country with which Canada has a YMA. The “Participation Fee” paid by approved foreign participants generates revenue to completely fund program costs. Key program activities include YMA negotiation and liaison with new and existing countries; promotion of program participation to Canadians and foreign nationals; and stakeholder engagement to facilitate participation and enhance program accessibility for Canadian youth. Foreign national participant application selection and processing involves the issuance of temporary resident visas and work permits to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants. Canadians’ applications are processed by the governments of the countries where they would like to participate.</p>

         <p>CIC is committed to upholding Canada’s humanitarian tradition of reuniting families, resettling refugees and providing protection to those in need.</p>  <p>The Family Class, as set forth in IRPA, allows permanent residents and Canadian citizens to sponsor their immediate family members (i.e., their spouse, common-law or conjugal partner, and dependent children), as well as&nbsp;parents and grandparents, for immigration to Canada. The permanent resident or Canadian citizen must undertake to provide for the basic needs of&nbsp;their sponsored relative&nbsp;for a set period of time, depending on the nature of the relationship. This program&nbsp;facilitates family reunification while ensuring that there is no undue cost to the general public.</p>  <p>As a signatory to the <em><a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsII.aspx?&amp;src=UNTSONLINE&amp;mtdsg_no=V~2&amp;chapter=5&amp;Temp=mtdsg2&amp;lang=en">1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a></em>, the <em><a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ShowMTDSGDetails.aspx?src=UNTSONLINE&amp;tabid=2&amp;mtdsg_no=V-5&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en#Participants">1967 Protocol</a></em>, and the<em> <a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a></em>, and further to provisions set forth in the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a></em>, Canada has international and domestic legal obligations to provide safe haven to individuals in need of protection. Canada meets these obligations through the in-Canada refugee protection system. In addition, Canada partners&nbsp;with other countries and with international and civil society organizations to come to the aid of refugees in need of protection through resettlement. Every year, Canada resettles 10,000 to 14,000 refugees, and is one of the top three resettlement countries globally. CIC engages both domestic and international stakeholders to develop and implement timely, efficient and effective refugee protection policies and programs.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>CIC plays a significant role in upholding Canada’s international humanitarian commitments and domestic obligations and Canada’s reputation with regard to refugees and in promoting the Canadian values of democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law. Through family sponsorship, CIC’s efforts enable Canadian citizens and permanent residents to reunite with family members. Following recent reforms, CIC’s refugee protection system ensures fast and fair review and decisions for those in genuine need of protection, and deters unfounded claims by minimizing factors that may attract refugee claims from persons who are not genuinely in need of protection. The refugee resettlement program is part of the important role that Canada plays in addressing international humanitarian crises and contributes to the safety and security of Canadians.</p>

         <p>CIC’s family and discretionary programs support the Government of Canada’s social goals for immigration. The program’s objectives are to reunite family members in Canada, and to allow for the processing of exceptional cases. Family Class provisions of IRPA enable Canadian citizens and permanent residents of Canada to apply to sponsor eligible members of the Family Class, including spouses and partners, dependent children, and parents and grandparents. Discretionary provisions in the legislation are used in cases where there are humanitarian and compassionate considerations or for public policy reasons. These discretionary provisions provide the flexibility to approve exceptional and deserving cases not anticipated in the legislation and to support the Government of Canada in its humanitarian response to world events and crises. Eligibility assessment and processing involve the granting of permanent or temporary residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.2.1.3">Sub-Program 2.1.3: Humanitarian and Compassionate and Public Policy Considerations</h5>  <p>The humanitarian and compassionate and public policy provisions of IRPA enable the Minister to address exceptional circumstances by granting an exception to certain criteria or obligations of the Act or by granting permanent or temporary residence. These discretionary provisions provide the flexibility to approve exceptional cases that were not envisioned in the legislation. Under the humanitarian and compassionate provisions of IRPA, an applicant’s circumstances are assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account establishment in Canada, the best interests of a child, and other relevant circumstances brought forward for consideration. The public policy provision is a discretionary tool designed to grant permanent or temporary resident status to individuals in similar circumstances, all of whom must meet eligibility criteria defined in the public policy. The outcome of this program is that exceptional cases are treated with appropriate flexibility, in accordance with Canadian values. Eligibility assessment and processing involve the granting of permanent or temporary residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>

Canadian visa officers select as permanent residents members of the Convention Refugees Abroad and Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad classes for resettlement in Canada who are referred by private sponsors. These private sponsors then provide the social, financial and emotional support to the refugees upon their arrival in Canada. The program is unique as it engages ordinary Canadians and permanent residents in Canada’s international refugee protection efforts and ensures an additional number of refugees are offered protection over and above those sponsored by the government.</p>

Under IRPA, people who have been issued a removal order can apply to CIC for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). When a person has already had a refugee protection claim assessed by the IRB, only new evidence, such as evidence that demonstrates a sudden change in country conditions, is considered. While some persons whose applications are approved may benefit from a stay of removal, others whose applications are approved may become “protected persons” and may apply and be granted permanent resident status. For most claimants, only one PRRA is allowed in a 12-month period – in other words, a claimant cannot apply for a PRRA for one year following a final decision on a refugee claim from the IRB or a final PRRA decision. For claimants from designated countries of origin, the bar on accessing a PRRA is 36 months.</p>

The program provides language learning services for newcomers, community and employment bridging services, settlement information, and support services that facilitate access to settlement programming. Also, through the <a href="../../mandate/foreign-credentials-referral-office.html">Foreign Credentials Referral Office</a>, the program provides information, path-finding and referral services to internationally trained individuals to have their credentials assessed quickly so they can find work in the fields in which they have been trained.

Settlement information, bridging and other support services including foreign credential referrals, attempt to address these barriers. SPOs are funded to design and deliver bridging services that facilitate newcomers’ connections to the labour market and the r community. Through CIC offices and SPOs, the program also provides prospective immigrants and newcomers with access to settlement-related information so that they can make informed decisions about immigrating to and settling in Canada. The program also funds SPOs to offer services that improve newcomers’ access to settlement programming; these support services include childminding and transportation. Information on foreign credential recognition is provided in-person and by telephone on behalf of the Foreign Credentials Referral Office by Service Canada and through the CIC Web site to prospective immigrants overseas.

The compensation to Quebec covers services for reception services and linguistic, cultural and economic integration services, provided that they are equivalent to similar federal services in other parts of the country. An objective of the Accord is, among other things, the preservation of Quebec’s demographic importance within Canada and the integration of immigrants into that province in a manner that respects the distinct identity of Quebec. The Accord provides Quebec with exclusive responsibility for the selection of immigrants destined to the province (except for family reunification and asylum seekers in Canada) as well as the reception and linguistic and cultural integration of these immigrants (including resettlement of refugees). Under the Accord, Canada is responsible for defining overall immigration objectives, national levels, admissibility, selecting family category and asylum seekers in Canada, and citizenship.

It ensures that some persons, otherwise unable to pay for the costs of transportation to Canada and medical admissibility exams, have access to a funding source. Assistance loans may also be approved for newcomers in need to cover initial settlement expenses such as rental and utilities deposits. The main target groups for the program are resettled refugees. These individuals have undergone extreme hardship and most often have few personal resources and are therefore unable to access traditional lending institutions. Canadian visa officers authorize the transportation and admissibility loans and the <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home.html">International Organization for Migration</a> arranges travel and medical exams for refugees and pays these costs. CIC reimburses them and the refugee reimburses CIC through loan repayments. Assistance loans are authorized by in-Canada officers. The interest-bearing loans are repayable in full and payment plans vary by the value of the loan and the recipients’ ability to repay while integrating.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Canada welcomes thousands of permanent residents, foreign nationals authorized for temporary work, international students and visitors each year. CIC manages the movement of people within the context of a more responsive immigration system that benefits Canada’s economic, social and cultural development while at the same time protecting the health, safety and security of all Canadians. CIC also ensures that Canadians can travel freely across international borders by abiding by international standards and specifications and applying rigour in the administration and monitoring of Canada’s Passport Program. To manage health issues related to immigration, CIC develops and implements risk mitigation strategies in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/">Public Health Agency of Canada</a>, provinces and territories, and partner countries. Any residual public health risks regarding the transmission of infectious diseases are mitigated through medical surveillance of newly arrived permanent and temporary residents as required. To protect Canadians—and to ensure that the benefits of a more responsive immigration system are not undermined—CIC works with the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/">Canada Border Services Agency</a>, the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> and the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> to conduct appropriate background screening of both immigrants and temporary residents and to identify applicants who could pose a security risk to the country. CIC shares information with these organizations, fostering timely and effective delivery of its program.</p>  <p>Internationally, migration and humanitarian issues continue to gain the attention of governments, bilateral and multilateral forums, non-governmental organizations, and academic and other research institutes. CIC plays an important role in framing and advancing&nbsp;international dialogues on migration and integration policy, refugee protection and&nbsp;governance. These dialogues explore the links between migration policy and development assistance, health, the environment, trade, and the movement of human capital.&nbsp;CIC works to develop and implement a strategic agenda on global migration and&nbsp;refugee protection, and to advance Canada’s policy and program priorities.</p>

        <h4>Benefits for Canadians</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Growing international migration has increased the possibility of Canadians being exposed to disease outbreaks and infectious diseases. CIC and its partners in health management work to reduce the impact of identified risks on the Canadian population.</p>  <p>Policies and programs that affect the international movement of people—across Canada’s borders and outside them—have a direct bearing on the safety and security of Canada and Canadians at large, whether they are at home, travelling and/or conducting trade abroad. Working in collaboration with domestic and international partners, CIC strives to achieve an effective balance between security and facilitation through the use and application of recognized identity management and travel document standards and specifications. Strengthening Canada’s refugee programs and demonstrating continued leadership in refugee protection, human rights and the promotion of cultural diversity through active participation in various international and regional forums and partnerships support Canada’s broader contribution to a safe and secure world. Finally, coordinated and responsible sharing of information supports a fast response to threats to the safety and security of Canadians.</p>

The program offers five types of coverage: Expanded Health Coverage, Health-Care Coverage, Public Health or Public Safety Health-Care Coverage, coverage for the IME and coverage for detainees. Most beneficiaries receive Health-Care Coverage, which is a level of coverage similar to the coverage Canadians receive through their provincial/territorial health insurance plans. The program helps protect public health and public safety and supports the successful settlement of resettled refugees receiving government support. IFH Program beneficiaries with valid coverage access health services through registered health care providers, who are reimbursed directly by the IFH claims administrator for covered services.</p>

         <p>CIC facilitates the travel of bona fide permanent residents, visitors, students and temporary workers while protecting the health, safety and security of Canadians by effectively managing migration access and controlling entry. This is accomplished through a variety of policy and operational measures, including through the establishment of visa and other document entry requirements and otherwise maintaining the policy framework for terms and conditions of entry, admissibility criteria, anti-fraud measures, negotiations of bilateral and multilateral information-sharing agreements and treaties, as well as setting identity management practices. Strategic partnership engagements with security and public safety-related departments are another essential component of this program.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.4.2.1">Sub-Program 4.2.1: Permanent Resident Status Documents</h5>  <p>In accordance with IRPA, CIC must process and issue to all permanent residents a secure status document for travel purposes. The permanent resident card serves as proof of permanent resident status in Canada and may be easily verified by commercial carriers and border officers. While the permanent resident card also meets international travel document standards, it is not a travel document. The Permanent Resident Status Documents Program makes it difficult to access Canadian territory fraudulently. The program establishes a mechanism to verify compliance with the residency requirement, provides permanent residents with a status document confirming their right to live, work and study in Canada, provides permanent residents with access to government services, and enables them to be recognized and processed quickly at the border, thereby enhancing border security. While not mandatory within Canada, the permanent resident card is required for all permanent residents as proof of their status when seeking to re-enter Canada on a commercial carrier. It contains security features to reduce the risk of fraud. Permanent residents who obtained their status under previous immigration legislation or those who wish to replace an expired, lost or stolen permanent resident card may obtain one upon application. Limited use travel documents are also issued by visa offices overseas to qualified permanent residents outside of Canada who do not have a valid permanent resident card, to facilitate return travel to Canada.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.4.2.2">Sub-Program 4.2.2: Visitors Status</h5>  <p>Under IRPA, all visitors to Canada require a temporary resident visa (TRV), except citizens of countries for which an exemption has been granted under the Regulations. A foreign national who wishes to come to Canada, and from a country for which a TRV is imposed, needs to apply at a Canadian embassy abroad prior to travelling to Canada. The Visitors Status Program aims to ensure that each applicant is screened to determine whether they meet the entry requirements, including that they will abide by the terms and conditions of entry, and are not inadmissible to Canada. The screening of travellers requiring a TRV is carried out by CIC in cooperation with its federal security partners. Once individuals arrive in Canada, their status needs to be maintained, regardless of whether they needed a visa to enter the country. <br> The TRV is designed to prevent individuals who would abuse temporary entry from coming to Canada, and to facilitate the entry to Canada of genuine temporary residents. The requirement to obtain a TRV limits the number of immigration violations (e.g., refugee claims, no proper travel documents, not leaving Canada once the period of stay has expired, working illegally, etc.) and protects the health, safety and security of Canadians.</p>

In some cases, however, there may be compelling reasons for an officer to issue a temporary resident permit (TRP) to allow a person who is otherwise inadmissible to enter or remain in Canada. Under the TRP Program, designated officers may issue these permits abroad, at a port of entry or in Canada, depending on the circumstances. Grounds for issuance of a TRP include, among others, inadmissibility due to medical reasons, criminality, reasons of security, infringement of human or international rights, or organized crime. TRPs are issued for a limited, often short, period of time and are subject to cancellation at any time. TRPs provide officers with the flexibility to address exceptional circumstances and, in so doing, maintain the integrity of Canada’s immigration program and protect the health, safety and security of Canadians.</p>

Program integrity is achieved through case processing procedures that identify and refuse status to applicants who fail to meet eligibility and/or admissibility requirements, including fraud, and through referral of these cases for enforcement action where appropriate. </p>  <p>Identity management contributes to strengthened program integrity by ensuring that services are delivered to the correct individual, developing efficiencies across multiple business lines, and allowing CIC to streamline interactions with repeat clientele.

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.4.2.5">Sub-Program 4.2.5: Global Assistance for Irregular Migrants</h5>  <p>The Global Assistance for Irregular Migrants (GAIM) Program provides transfer payments in the form of contributions to trusted international, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations (such as the <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home.html">International Organization for Migration</a>) to fund activities and support for intercepted irregular migrants, such as meeting basic needs, providing medical care, identifying migrants to be referred to the appropriate authorities for refugee status determination, and facilitating voluntary return and reintegration in the country of origin if determined not to be in need of protection. The GAIM Program responds to the need for Canada to have a permanent program to manage the consequences of disrupting human-smuggling activities believed to be destined for Canada. It is triggered when the Prime Minister’s Special Advisor on Human Smuggling identifies an event involving these activities and CIC agrees to implement the program. It also addresses the need for complementary activities that demonstrate Canada’s commitment to transit states and international partners that would otherwise be encumbered with the costs of unintended consequences arising from smuggling-prevention activities. Offers of capacity building and support in managing the consequences of successful prevention of human smuggling have been critical in securing bilateral cooperation from transit states. The GAIM Program reflects CIC’s role in Canada’s whole-of-government strategy to combat human-smuggling activities. The program uses transfer payment funding from the contribution in support of the GAIM Program.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p><strong>appropriation:</strong> Any authority of Parliament to pay money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>  <p><strong>budgetary expenditures:</strong> Include operating and capital expenditures; transfer payments to other levels of government, organizations or individuals; and payments to Crown corporations.</p>  <p><strong>Departmental Performance Report:</strong> Reports on an appropriated organization’s actual accomplishments against the plans, priorities and expected results set out in the corresponding Reports on Plans and Priorities. These reports are tabled in Parliament in the fall.</p>  <p><strong>full-time equivalent:</strong> Is a measure of the extent to which an employee represents a full person-year charge against a departmental budget. Full-time equivalents are calculated as a ratio of assigned hours of work to scheduled hours of work. Scheduled hours of work are set out in collective agreements.</p>  <p><strong>Government of Canada outcomes:</strong> A set of 16 high-level objectives defined for the government as a whole, grouped in <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ppg-cpr/frame-cadre-eng.aspx">four spending areas</a>: economic affairs, social affairs, international affairs and government affairs.</p>  <p><strong>Management, Resources and Results Structure:</strong> A comprehensive framework that consists of an organization’s inventory of programs, resources, results, performance indicators and governance information. Programs and results are depicted in their hierarchical relationship to each other and to the Strategic Outcome(s) to which they contribute. The Management, Resources and Results Structure is developed from the Program Alignment Architecture.</p>  <p><strong>non-budgetary expenditures:</strong> Include net outlays and receipts related to loans, investments and advances, which change the composition of the financial assets of the Government of Canada.</p>  <p><strong>performance:</strong> What an organization did with its resources to achieve its results, how well those results compare to what the organization intended to achieve and how well lessons learned have been identified.</p>  <p><strong>performance indicator:</strong> A qualitative or quantitative means of measuring an output or outcome, with the intention of gauging the performance of an organization, program, policy or initiative respecting expected results.</p>  <p><strong>performance reporting:</strong> The process of communicating evidence-based performance information. Performance reporting supports decision making, accountability and transparency.</p>  <p><strong>planned spending:</strong> For Reports on Plans and Priorities (RPPs) and Departmental Performance Reports (DPRs), planned spending refers to those amounts that receive Treasury Board approval by February 1. Therefore, planned spending may include amounts incremental to planned expenditures presented in the Main Estimates.<br> A department is expected to be aware of the authorities that it has sought and received. The determination of planned spending is a departmental responsibility, and departments must be able to defend the expenditure and accrual numbers presented in their RPPs and DPRs.</p>  <p><strong>plans:</strong> The articulation of strategic choices, which provides information on how an organization intends to achieve its priorities and associated results. Generally a plan will explain the logic behind the strategies chosen and tend to focus on actions that lead up to the expected result.</p>  <p><strong>priorities:</strong> Plans or projects that an organization has chosen to focus and report on during the planning period. Priorities represent the things that are most important or what must be done first to support the achievement of the desired Strategic Outcome(s).</p>  <p><strong>program:</strong> A group of related resource inputs and activities that are managed to meet specific needs and to achieve intended results and that are treated as a budgetary unit.</p>  <p><strong>Program Alignment Architecture:</strong> A structured inventory of an organization’s programs depicting the hierarchical relationship between programs and the Strategic Outcome(s) to which they contribute.</p>  <p><strong>Report on Plans and Priorities:</strong> Provides information on the plans and expected performance of appropriated organizations over a three-year period. These reports are tabled in Parliament each spring.</p>  <p><strong>results:</strong> An external consequence attributed, in part, to an organization, policy, program or initiative. Results are not within the control of a single organization, policy, program or initiative; instead they are within the area of the organization’s influence.</p>  <p><strong>Strategic Outcome:</strong> A long-term and enduring benefit to Canadians that is linked to the organization’s mandate, vision and core functions.</p>  <p><strong>sunset program:</strong> A time-limited program that does not have an ongoing funding and policy authority. When the program is set to expire, a decision must be made whether to continue the program. In the case of a renewal, the decision specifies the scope, funding level and duration.</p>  <p><strong>target:</strong> A measurable performance or success level that an organization, program or initiative plans to achieve within a specified time period. Targets can be either quantitative or qualitative.</p>  <p><strong>whole-of-government framework:</strong> Maps the financial contributions of federal organizations receiving appropriations by aligning their Programs to a set of 16 government-, high-level outcome areas, grouped under four spending areas.</p>
