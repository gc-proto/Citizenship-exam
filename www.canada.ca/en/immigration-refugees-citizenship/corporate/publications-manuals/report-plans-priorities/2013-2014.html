<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>I am pleased to present the 2013–2014 Report on Plans and Priorities for Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).</p>  <p>The Government of Canada remains focused on the economy and on job growth. Immigration is a key part of this plan, and the government is committed to ensuring that our immigration system supports our objectives of jobs, growth and long-term prosperity, while maintaining family reunification goals and humanitarian obligations.</p>  <p>Since 2006, the Government of Canada has welcomed the highest sustained levels of immigration in Canadian history. For the seventh consecutive year, Canada will maintain an overall admissions range of between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents. </p>  <p>Over the past year, the government implemented transformative changes to Canada’s immigration system to make it faster and more flexible, better aligning it with labour market needs. In 2013–2014, the government will continue with comprehensive reforms to ensure that newcomers have the best possible chance at success, that Canada’s immigration system fuels economic growth, and that the system continues to be based on the consistent application of fair rules.</p>  <p>Throughout 2013, we will welcome approximately 158,600 immigrants, or 62 percent of all projected admissions, through various economic immigration programs. On May 4, 2013, the Federal Skilled Worker Program will re-open to applications, which will be subject to an updated points system that is based on extensive research on the factors most associated with economic success of newcomers. By assigning more weight to applicants who have language proficiency, are younger and have pre-arranged job offers, we expect to see economic outcomes of newcomers improve. </p>  <p>Two new economic immigration programs are opening for applications in 2013. The new Federal Skilled Trades Program opened on January 2, 2013, to address the fact that for too long, the immigration system was largely closed to these in-demand workers. The new Skilled Trades stream will help address serious labour shortages in some regions of the country, and support economic growth.</p>  <p>In addition, on April 1, 2013, the new Start-Up Visa Program will open for applications. This program, which is the first of its kind in the world, will match brilliant, innovative, in-demand immigrant entrepreneurs with Canadian venture capital organizations and angel investors so as to spark economic growth and job creation. We are committed to positioning Canada as a serious competitor for global talent, seeking to attract the world’s best and brightest. </p>  <p>The government will also move toward the launch of a new Expression of Interest system by the end of 2014 to create a pool of skilled applicants. This system will radically improve the way Canada selects economic immigrants, and move us from a slow, supply-driven system to one in which governments and employers actively select candidates who can best meet immediate and future economic needs. </p>  <p>The year 2013 is also expected to be another record year for admissions under the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). We expect to welcome up to 10,000 international student graduates and skilled foreign workers through this popular program. The CEC is currently the fastest growing economic stream, as Canada seeks to capitalize on the Canadian work experience and language skills these individuals possess. </p>  <p>In the coming year, CIC will continue to strengthen its other successful economic immigration programs. For example, the Provincial Nominee Program will welcome between 42,000 and 45,000 new admissions. CIC will continue to work with provincial and territorial partners to ensure that the integrity of the program is maintained, so as to best meet regional economic needs. </p>  <p>In 2013, Canada plans to admit 73,300 Family Class immigrants, equivalent to 27 percent of total admissions. This includes the admission of approximately 50,000 parents and grandparents in 2012 and 2013, and represents an increase of 60 percent from 2012, and the highest levels in nearly two decades. The government is on track to reduce the backlog of parents and grandparents by 50 percent by the end of 2013, in preparation for the launch of a modernized parents and grandparents program, one that ensures that future applications are processed quickly and that the program operates on a sustainable basis. We will also continue to promote the highly successful Parent and Grandparent Super Visa as a practical and faster way for families to reunite. More than 10,000 super visas were issued in 2012 alone, with an 87 percent acceptance rate.</p>  <p>Canada is committed to its international obligations toward those facing persecution. We already accept one out of every ten resettled refugees world – more than almost any other country in the world. We continue to enhance our tradition of refugee protection. In 2013, our humanitarian programs are projected to welcome approximately 28,500 vulnerable individuals, or 11 percent of Canada’s total newcomers.</p>  <p>As a result of reforms included in the <em>Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act</em>, bona fide refugees will receive protection in a timelier manner, as Canada continues to implement its new asylum system that came into effect in December 2012. With the ability to expedite processing of claims from countries that do not normally produce refugees, we have already seen a massive drop in asylum claims, including a dramatic drop in claims from Hungary, which used to be Canada’s top source country for such claims. </p>  <p>The government is also preparing to implement the <em>Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act</em>, pending passage of the legislation. This bill will ensure that foreign criminals will no longer be able to exploit lengthy appeals and loopholes to avoid deportation.</p>  <p>In the context of Canada–U.S. agreements on continental perimeter security, CIC will implement a number of initiatives to enhance our ability to screen travellers seeking to cross our borders, and to prevent criminals, terrorists and other inadmissible individuals from entering Canada, while at the same time facilitating the flow of legitimate visitors and goods between both countries. In 2013, we will begin to screen visitors from certain countries using biometric data and will initiate systematic immigration information-sharing with the United States. Work is continuing toward the implementation of both an electronic travel authorization system and an entry-exit system with the United States by 2015.</p>  <p>In 2013, we will continue to implement the Citizenship Action Plan to strengthen the value of Canadian citizenship. We will implement necessary reforms as a result of a comprehensive review of citizenship policy, which has been completed. We will also continue to address residency and citizenship fraud.</p>  <p>In the year ahead, the federal government will fully resume responsibility of settlement services funding and delivery in Manitoba and British Columbia. Work is ongoing to ensure that a similar level of settlement services is available across the country, to help newcomers integrate and fully participate in our economy as soon as possible upon arrival.</p>  <p>Canada assumes the position of Chair of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in March 2013. Canada’s chairmanship will be supported by CIC.</p>  <p>Overall, CIC will continue to modernize and improve the efficiency of our operations. Key areas of focus remain the reduction of backlogs that lead to long wait times and continuing with the transformational change to Canada’s immigration system.</p>  <p>As Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, I am pleased to present these plans and priorities, confident that they support our objectives of economic growth and job creation, while maintaining our tradition of family reunification and humanitarian protection.</p>  <p>I would like to thank CIC staff for their hard work and ongoing dedication and support in planning and implementing these transformational reforms to Canada’s immigration system.</p>  <br>

         <p>In the first years after Confederation, Canada’s leaders had a powerful vision: to connect Canada by rail and make the West the world’s breadbasket as a foundation for the country’s economic prosperity. This vision meant quickly populating the Prairies, leading the Government of Canada to establish its first national immigration policies. Immigrants have been a driving force in Canada’s nationhood and its economic prosperity—as farmers settling lands, as workers in factories fuelling industrial growth, as entrepreneurs and as innovators helping Canada to compete in the global, knowledge-based economy.</p>

         <p><a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca">Citizenship and Immigration Canada</a> (CIC) selects foreign nationals as permanent and temporary residents and offers Canada’s protection to refugees. The Department develops Canada’s admissibility policy, which sets the conditions for entering and remaining in Canada; it also conducts, in collaboration with its partners, the screening of potential permanent and temporary residents to protect the health, safety and security of Canadians. Fundamentally, the Department builds a stronger Canada by helping immigrants and refugees settle and integrate into Canadian society and the economy, and by encouraging and facilitating Canadian citizenship. To achieve this, CIC&nbsp;operates 27 in-Canada points of service and 70 points of service in 63 countries.</p>  <p>CIC’s broad mandate is partly derived from the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-29.4/index.html">Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act</a></em>. The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration Canada is responsible for the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-29/index.html">Citizenship Act</a></em> of 1977 and shares responsibility with the Minister of Public Safety for the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/i-2.5/index.html">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a></em> (IRPA), which came into force following major legislative reform in 2002. CIC and the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/">Canada Border Services Agency</a> support their respective ministers in the administration and enforcement of IRPA. These organizations work collaboratively to achieve and balance the objectives of the immigration and refugee programs.</p>  <p>In October 2008, responsibility for administration of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-18.7"><em>Canadian Multiculturalism Act</em></a> was transferred to CIC from the Department of Canadian Heritage. Under the Act, CIC promotes the integration of individuals and communities into all aspects of Canadian society and helps to build a stronger, more cohesive society. Jurisdiction over immigration is a shared responsibility between the federal and the provincial and territorial governments under section 95 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-1.html"><em>Constitution Act</em>, <em>1867</em></a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>In 2013–2014, CIC will continue to advance extensive changes to create a modern and dynamic immigration system. Fast and flexible, it will respond effectively to Canada’s labour market needs, support reunification of families and provide protection to refugees. To deliver on these goals, CIC maintains an Integrated Risk Management Framework that it uses to develop risk management strategies, to continually identify, update and monitor risks that could potentially affect the achievement of the Department’s strategic objectives. </p>  <p>CIC’s strategic directions, as well as its policies and operations, are influenced by numerous external factors such as emerging events, the Canadian and global economic, social and political contexts, and shifting migration trends. CIC also continuously advances its own internal systems through change initiatives such as the modernization agenda. </p>  <p>Although Canada has endured the global economic downturn comparatively well, world economic uncertainty persists, and some countries continue to undergo transition and unrest. This may mean increased numbers of migrants moving for reasons of economic and social security. Nationally, employment recovery lags behind economic growth. Our immigration policies must ensure that we continue to welcome only as many newcomers as the economy can sustain.</p>  <p>At the same time, Canada’s own economic challenges require CIC to think about the role that the immigration system must play in safeguarding our future prosperity. Even in a time of economic uncertainty, Canada needs a robust immigration system to keep its work force strong. As in other countries with aging populations and low birth rates, immigration has become a tool for responding to current and future labour market needs. Persistent labour and skills shortages in many economic sectors have contributed to the growing demand for skilled workers across the country, including outside Canada’s major cities, which traditionally have been magnets for migrants.</p>  <p>CIC’s policy initiatives are consistent with the government’s goal of supporting economic recovery and responding to Canada’s shifting labour market needs. The Expression of Interest immigrant selection model currently under development will help transform Canada’s system into one that is more responsive to labour market demand. Modelled after the successful approach in New Zealand and Australia, the Expression of Interest model will ensure a greater role for employers and for federal, provincial and territorial governments in the selection of immigrants and in the creation of a pool of skilled workers who are ready to be employed in Canada.</p>  <p>A temporary pause on new applications to the Federal Skilled Worker Program and the Federal Immigrant Investor Program introduced in 2012 has provided an opportunity to reexamine these programs. While a pause on the acceptance of applications under the Federal Skilled Worker Program (except for those with an arranged employment offer or those made under the PhD stream) has continued, a sixth set of Ministerial Instructions under s. 87.3 of IRPA was issued to permit the processing of applications made under the Federal Skilled Trades Class, a new class of economic permanent residents established by regulation on January 2, 2013. The instructions establish an annual maximum of&nbsp;3,000 new applications submitted for consideration in specific trades for the new Federal Skilled Trades Class. Improvements to the Federal Skilled Worker Program will be introduced at the same time as the pause is lifted, currently anticipated for May 4, 2013. Based on findings of an extensive program evaluation, consultations and other research, the Federal Skilled Worker Program selection criteria will be adjusted by making language the most important selection factor, increasing emphasis on younger immigrants, increasing points for Canadian work experience and making an Educational Credential Assessment a mandatory requirement. CIC is currently exploring a pilot investor program in consultation with stakeholders, provinces and territories.</p>  <p>Fragile economic conditions add to newcomers’ already challenging task of building a new life in Canada—immigrants today feel the pressure to integrate quickly into the economy and adapt to the multifaceted socio-cultural environment. Although Canada responded to labour shortages over a number of years by maintaining relatively high levels of immigration, too many newcomers ended up unemployed or underemployed relative to the general population. Research into this phenomenon has suggested ways to enhance newcomers’ chances to succeed, including increasing the number of immigrants arriving with arranged employment, strong official language abilities, and recognition of skills and training acquired overseas.</p>  <p>CIC recognizes the need to provide comparable, high-quality services for newcomers regardless of where they choose to settle in Canada and is moving toward a more consistent approach to settlement service delivery. In 2013–2014 for Manitoba and 2014–2015 for British Columbia, CIC will assume responsibility for the design, delivery and management of federally funded settlement services that these provinces previously administered. This will help to better align settlement service delivery across the country outside of Quebec. The Department will also advance recognition of foreign credentials for more regulated occupations by continuing to implement the Pan-Canadian Framework for the Assessment and Recognition of Foreign Qualifications and introducing a requirement for federal skilled workers to have their foreign credentials assessed and verified by designated organizations before their arrival in Canada. </p>  <p>Alongside emphasizing fast and flexible economic immigration, CIC remains committed to its objectives under the family and humanitarian programs, as well as to maintaining Canadians’ confidence in the system with respect to integrity and processing times. Canada’s new asylum system came fully into force on December 15, 2012, as part of the <em>Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act, </em>which received Royal Assent on June 28, 2012. These changes include the authority to designate countries of origin that respect human rights, offer state protection and, based on historical data from the Immigration and Refugee Board, do not normally produce refugees. </p>  <p>It is essential for CIC to safeguard program integrity across the immigration and citizenship continuum and manage access to Canada while protecting the health, safety and security of Canadians. In response to risks to program integrity, the Department will further its strategies to detect and prevent all threats that could undermine public confidence in the immigration and citizenship system, while improving the quality of decision making. CIC will also continue implementing the Canada–United States <em><a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/beyond-border-action-plan">Beyond the Border Action Plan</a></em>, which will help enhance security in the continental perimeter shared with the United States, while speeding up legitimate trade and travel across the border. The <em>Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act</em> also allows for the collection of biometric data from temporary resident visa applicants, which will strengthen Canada’s ability to ensure that the individual who was approved to travel is the same person entering Canada.</p>  <p>Recent years saw a remarkable emergence of new technologies. In an increasingly global and interdependent world, Canada must keep pace with other countries and various partners in making use of the best available tools to manage a modern immigration system. CIC has seized this opportunity to significantly transform service delivery across its network, making processes more modern, accessible and responsive for clients, while ensuring the integrity of its programs. Key examples include the introduction of eMedical certificates and the future development of a new platform for Expression of Interest. In this time of fiscal restraint, CIC is also streamlining its services to provide more nimble, efficient service to newcomers and Canadians. For this reason, one of CIC’s organizational priorities remains improving and modernizing client service, such as the expansion of on-line applications.</p>  <p>As the Department moves operations away from traditional paper-based systems to a comprehensive electronic suite of processing and services solutions, CIC will increasingly rely on information management and information technology (IM/IT) systems and infrastructure to support its business lines, many of which also affect other delivery partners, such as the Canada Border Services Agency. CIC must proactively manage risk while maximizing the use of available technological solutions. To this end, CIC works closely with Shared Services Canada and continuously reviews and implements technology and system strategies to ensure they align with the needs of the business, are responsive to changes in business strategy, and maximize the use and integration of IM/IT systems with business processes.</p>  <p>As CIC deals with ever-changing external and internal environments with limited resources, rapid technological change and growing public scrutiny, there is an increasing demand to become even better at anticipating and managing risks, both within the Department and for Canadians. CIC must remain diligent in effectively managing its resources to achieve its strategic outcomes and operational objectives, while minimizing exposure to a variety of risks.</p>

         <p><strong>Explanation of Change:</strong> In 2014–2015, total planned spending decreases by $162 million compared with the previous year. The main reason for this decrease is the reduction in temporary funding for statutory payments to reimburse fees for certain federal skilled worker applications. Also included in this change are planned reductions in funding related to the Temporary Resident Biometrics Project, modernization of the immigration system and information sharing with the United States. Savings identified as part of the Budget 2012 spending review also contribute to the decrease.</p>  <p>Planned spending in 2015–2016 declines by $28 million primarily due to the end of temporary funding for statutory payments to reimburse fees for certain federal skilled worker applications. Also contributing to this decrease are planned reductions in funding related to the reform of the refugee determination system and information sharing with the United States.</p>

         <p>For the 2013–2014 fiscal year, CIC plans to spend $1,655.4 million to achieve the results expected from its programs. The chart below illustrates CIC’s spending trend from 2009–2010 to 2015–2016.</p>  <p>Overall, the Department’s planned spending will decrease from current levels to $1,465.2 million in 2015–2016. This decrease is largely due to the impacts of the Budget 2012 spending review. During this period, planned funding also decreases to ongoing levels for initiatives such as the Temporary Resident Biometrics Project and information sharing with the United States.</p>  <p>Planned spending in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 includes temporary statutory funding to reimburse fees for certain federal skilled worker applications as announced in Budget 2012.</p>

         <p>The Federal Sustainable Development Strategy (FSDS) outlines the Government of Canada’s commitment to improving the transparency of environmental decision making by articulating its key strategic environmental goals and targets. The government will be consulting the public in 2013–2014 regarding the second three-year cycle of the FSDS (2013–2016). The 2013–2016 FSDS will be finalized in 2013–2014. It will be presented as part of year-end performance reporting for 2013–2014.</p>  <p>CIC ensures that consideration of these outcomes is an integral part of its decision-making processes. In particular, through the federal strategic environmental assessment process, any new policy, plan or program initiative includes an analysis of its impact on attaining the FSDS goals and targets. The results of strategic environmental assessments are made public when an initiative is announced, demonstrating the Department’s commitment to achieving the FSDS goals and targets. </p>  <p>CIC contributes to Theme IV of the FSDS, Shrinking the Environmental Footprint—Beginning with Government, as denoted by the visual identifier below.</p>

The section also provides details on each program, such as the expected results, performance indicators, targets, planning highlights, and the related financial and non-financial resources. As part of its PAA and PMF implementation strategy, CIC identified the systematic collection, interpretation and analysis of performance measurement results as a key annual activity.

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>CIC plays a significant role in fostering Canada’s economic development. By promoting Canada as a destination of choice for innovation, investment and opportunity, CIC encourages talented individuals to come to Canada and to contribute to our prosperity. Canada’s immigration program is based on non-discriminatory principles—foreign nationals are assessed without regard to race, nationality, ethnic origin, colour, religion or gender. Those who are selected to immigrate to Canada have the skills, education, language competencies and work experience to make an immediate economic contribution.</p>  <p>CIC’s efforts, whether through policy and program development or processing applications for the Federal Skilled Worker Program, the Quebec Skilled Worker Program, the Provincial Nominee Program or other programs, attract thousands of qualified permanent residents each year. Under the 2008 amendments to IRPA the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration Canada has the authority to issue instructions establishing priorities for processing certain categories of applications. In that regard, the Department analyses and monitors its programs to ensure they are responsive to emerging labour market needs.</p>  <p>CIC also facilitates the hiring of foreign nationals by Canadian employers on a temporary basis and implements a number of initiatives to attract and retain international students.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Immigration continues to have a significant influence on Canadian society and economic development. Permanent residents who arrive in Canada every year enhance Canada’s social fabric, contribute to labour market growth and strengthen the economy. Changes that modernize and improve the immigration system not only strengthen the integrity of the Permanent Economic Residents program but also benefit Canada by targeting skills Canadian employers need and admitting qualified individuals more quickly.</p>  <p>Temporary foreign workers help generate growth for a number of Canadian industries by meeting short-term and acute needs in the labour market that are not easily filled by the domestic labour force. International students contribute economically as consumers and enrich the fabric of Canadian society through their diverse experiences and talents. Some temporary workers and international students represent a key talent pool to be retained as immigrants.</p>

         <p>Rooted in objectives outlined in IRPA the focus of this Program is on the selection and processing of immigrants who can support the development of a strong and prosperous Canada, in which the benefits of immigration are shared across all regions of Canada. The acceptance of qualified permanent residents helps the government meet its economic objectives, such as building a skilled work force, addressing immediate and longer term labour market needs, and supporting national and regional labour force growth. The selection and processing involve the issuance of a permanent resident visa to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>  <p><strong>Financial Resources ($ millions)</strong></p>

         <p>CIC is committed to upholding Canada’s humanitarian tradition of reuniting families, resettling refugees and providing protection to those in need.</p>  <p>The Family Class, as set forth in IRPA allows permanent residents and Canadian citizens to sponsor their immediate family members (i.e., their spouse, common-law or conjugal partner, and dependent children), as well as&nbsp;parents and grandparents, for immigration to Canada. The permanent resident or Canadian citizen must undertake to provide for the basic needs of&nbsp;their sponsored relative&nbsp;for a set period of time, depending on the nature of the relationship. This program&nbsp;facilitates family reunification while ensuring that there is no undue cost to the general public.</p>  <p>As a signatory to the <em><a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html">1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a></em>, the <em><a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocolrefugees.htm">1967 Protocol</a></em>, and the<em> <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a></em>, and further to provisions set forth in the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html#h-39">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a></em>, Canada has international and domestic legal obligations to provide safe haven to individuals in need of protection. Canada meets these obligations through the in-Canada refugee status determination system. In addition, Canada partners&nbsp;with other countries and with international and civil society organizations to come to the aid of individuals in need of protection through resettlement. Every year, Canada resettles 10,000 to 12,000—or one out of every 10—of the refugees resettled globally. CIC engages both domestic and international stakeholders to develop and implement timely, efficient and effective refugee protection policies and programs.</p>  <p><strong>Benefits for Canadians</strong></p>  <p>Promoting human rights and protecting refugees has been a cornerstone of Canada’s humanitarian tradition since the Second World War. CIC plays a significant role in upholding Canada’s international and domestic obligations and reputation with regard to refugees and in promoting the Canadian values of democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law. Through family sponsorship, CIC’s efforts enable Canadian citizens and permanent residents to reunite with family members.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>CIC’s Family and Discretionary programs support the Government of Canada’s social goals for immigration. The Program objectives are to reunite family members and to allow for the processing of exceptional cases. Family Class provisions of IRPA enable Canadian citizens and permanent residents of Canada to apply to sponsor eligible members of the Family Class, including spouses and partners, dependent children, and parents and grandparents. Discretionary provisions in the legislation are used in cases where there are humanitarian and compassionate considerations or for public policy reasons. These discretionary provisions provide the flexibility to approve exceptional and deserving cases not anticipated in the legislation and to support the Government of Canada in its humanitarian response to world events and crises. The selection and processing involve the issuance of a permanent resident visa or granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>  <p><strong>Financial Resources ($ millions)</strong></p>

One arm of the program starts overseas where refugees and persons in refugee-like situations are selected by Canadian visa officers to be resettled as permanent residents to Canada. Flowing from Canada’s international and domestic legal obligations, the in-Canada asylum system evaluates the claims of individuals seeking asylum in Canada and grants permanent residence when a positive decision is rendered by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.</p>  <p><strong>Financial Resources ($ millions)</strong></p>

         <p>The purpose of the Citizenship Program is to administer citizenship legislation and promote the rights and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship. CIC administers the acquisition of Canadian citizenship by developing, implementing, and applying legislation, regulations and policies that protect the integrity of Canadian citizenship and allow eligible applicants to be granted citizenship or be provided with a proof of citizenship. In addition, the program promotes citizenship, to both newcomers and the Canadian-born, through various events, materials and projects. Promotional activities focus on enhancing knowledge of Canada’s history, institutions and values, as well as fostering an understanding of the rights and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship.</p>  <p><strong>Financial Resources ($ millions)</strong></p>

         <p>The Multiculturalism Program is the principal means of carrying out the Minister’s responsibilities under the <em>Canadian Multiculturalism Act </em>for promoting the full and equitable participation of individuals and communities of all origins. Grants and contributions to not-for-profit organizations, the private sector, provincial and municipal governments, non-federal public institutions, and individuals seek to advance overarching Program objectives. These objectives are to: build an integrated, cohesive society (through intercultural understanding, civic memory and pride and democratic values, and equality of opportunity); improve the responsiveness of institutions to the needs of a diverse population; and actively engage in discussions on multiculturalism and diversity at the international level. Direct public outreach and promotional activities by the Program primarily target young people. The Program assists federal partners to meet their obligations under the Act and ensures annual reporting to Parliament on its operation. It also engages with non-federal public institutions seeking to respond to diversity. The Program provides a forum for cooperation with provinces and territories and is the locus for Canada’s participation in international agreements and institutions with respect to multiculturalism, anti-racism and related issues.</p>  <p><strong>Financial Resources ($ millions)</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Canada welcomes thousands of permanent residents, temporary foreign workers, international students and visitors each year. CIC manages the movement of people within the context of a more responsive immigration system that benefits Canada’s economic, social and cultural development while at the same time protecting the health, safety and security of all Canadians. To manage health issues related to immigration, CIC develops and implements risk mitigation strategies in cooperation with the <a href="../../../../public-health.html">Public Health Agency of Canada</a>, provinces and territories, and partner countries. Any residual public health risks regarding the transmission of infectious diseases are mitigated through medical surveillance of newly arrived permanent and temporary residents as required. To protect Canadians—and to ensure that the benefits of a more responsive immigration system are not undermined—CIC works with the Canada Border Services Agency, the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> and the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> to conduct appropriate background screening of both immigrants and temporary residents and to identify applicants who could pose a security risk to the country. CIC shares information with these organizations, fostering timely and effective delivery of its program.</p>  <p>Internationally, migration and humanitarian issues continue to gain the attention of governments, bilateral and multilateral forums, non-governmental organizations, and academic and other research institutes. CIC plays an important role in framing and advancing&nbsp;international dialogues on migration and integration policy, refugee protection and&nbsp;governance. These dialogues explore the links between migration policy and development assistance, health, the environment, trade, and the movement of human capital.&nbsp;CIC works to develop and implement a strategic agenda on global migration and&nbsp;refugee protection, and to advance Canada’s policy and program priorities.</p>  <p><strong>Benefits for Canadians</strong></p>  <p>Growing international migration has increased the possibility of Canadians being exposed to disease outbreaks and infectious diseases. CIC and its partners in health management work to reduce the impact of identified risks on the Canadian population.</p>  <p>Policies and programs that affect the international movement of people—across Canada’s borders and outside them—have a direct bearing on the safety and security of Canada and Canadians at large, whether they are at home or travelling and conducting trade abroad. Strengthening Canada’s refugee programs and demonstrating continued leadership in refugee protection, human rights and the promotion of cultural diversity through active participation in various international and regional forums and partnerships support Canada’s broader contribution to a safe and secure world. Finally, coordinated and responsible sharing of information supports a fast response to threats to the safety and security of Canadians.</p>

         <p>This Program aims to ensure the managed migration of foreign nationals and newcomers to Canada. As such, in accordance with IRPA and accompanying Regulations, CIC facilitates the travel of bona fide permanent residents, visitors, students and temporary workers while protecting the health, safety and security of Canadians by effectively managing migration access and controlling entry. This is accomplished through a variety of policy and operational measures, including visa policy interventions, anti-fraud measures, eligibility and admissibility criteria, negotiations of bilateral and multilateral information sharing agreements and treaties, security updates to travel and immigration status documents, as well as revisions to identity management practices. Strategic partnership engagements with security and public safety-related departments are another essential component of this Program. </p>  <p><strong>Financial Resources ($ millions)</strong></p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The decrease in net financial assets is explained by the decrease in the amount due from Consolidated Revenue Fund, which represents amounts the Department needs in order to meet its future liabilities. This amount is reduced as a result of the partial liquidation of liabilities, as described below.</p>  <p>The forecasted decrease in net liabilities is substantially attributable to the anticipated return of fees that were paid to the Department for federal skilled worker applications affected by the backlog elimination measure under the Government of Canada’s <em>Jobs, Growth and Long-Term Prosperity Act</em>. In addition, in January 2012, the Northwest Territories officially retracted from the Immigrant Investor Program and returned $113 million to CIC. Of this amount, $46 million is expected to be repaid to the individual investors in 2012–2013 and $43 million in 2013–2014. Finally, there is an expected decrease of $11&nbsp;million in employee future benefits in 2013–2014 due to the severance benefit termination and related cash-outs.</p>

         <p>Under the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</em>, CIC is accountable to Parliament for conducting gender-based analysis (GBA) on the impact of the Act and its regulations. A new departmental policy on GBA has been successfully implemented and will continue to ensure that the impact of policies, programs, legislation and services on diverse groups of women and men of all ages is taken into account. The Department will collaborate with the interdepartmental community on GBA, as well as with Status of Women Canada, with a view to exchanging best practices. Several initiatives have been identified as models of good practice for the coming year and will serve as important learning tools for the Department. CIC will continue to use gender-disaggregated data in research and evaluation activities and will apply GBA in areas such as client needs, program participation rates and program outcomes. For more information on CIC’s plans and activities with respect to GBA, consult Section V of the Department’s <em><a href="../../publications-manuals.html#department">annual reports to Parliament on immigration</a></em>. </p>
