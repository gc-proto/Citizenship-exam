        <h3>PART III—Departmental Expenditure Plans: Reports on Plans and Priorities</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Reports on Plans and Priorities (RPP) are individual expenditure plans for each department and agency. These reports provide increased levels of detail over a three-year period on an organization’s main priorities by strategic outcome, program and planned/expected results, including links to related resource requirements presented in the Main Estimates. In conjunction with the Main Estimates, Reports on Plans and Priorities serve to inform members of Parliament on planned expenditures of departments and agencies, and support Parliament’s consideration of supply bills. The RPPs are typically tabled soon after the Main Estimates by the President of the Treasury Board.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Estimates Documents</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The Estimates are comprised of three parts:</p>  <p>Part I—Government Expenditure Plan—provides an overview of the Government’s requirements and changes in estimated expenditures from previous fiscal years.</p>  <p>Part II—Main Estimates—supports the appropriation acts with detailed information on the estimated spending and authorities being sought by each federal organization requesting appropriations.</p>  <p>In accordance with Standing Orders of the House of Commons, Parts I and II must be tabled on or before March 1.</p>  <p>Part III—Departmental Expenditure Plans—consists of two components:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Report on Plans and Priorities (RPP)</li> 
 <li>Departmental Performance Report (DPR)</li> 
</ul>  <p>DPRs are individual department and agency accounts of results achieved against planned performance expectations as set out in respective RPPs.</p>  <p>The DPRs for the most recently completed fiscal year are tabled in the fall by the President of the Treasury Board.</p>  <p>Supplementary Estimates support Appropriation Acts presented later in the fiscal year. Supplementary Estimates present information on spending requirements that were either not sufficiently developed in time for inclusion in the Main Estimates or have subsequently been refined to account for developments in particular programs and services. Supplementary Estimates also provide information on changes to expenditure forecasts of major statutory items as well as on such items as: transfers of funds between votes; debt deletion; loan guarantees; and new or increased grants.</p>  <p>For more information on the Estimates, please consult the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ems-sgd/esp-pbc/esp-pbc-eng.asp">Treasury Board Secretariat Web site</a>.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Links to the Estimates</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>As shown above, RPPs make up part of the Part III of the Estimates documents. Whereas Part II emphasizes the financial aspect of the Estimates, Part III focuses on financial and non-financial performance information, both from a planning and priorities standpoint (RPP), and an achievements and results perspective (DPR).</p>  <p>The Management, Resources and Results Structure (MRRS) establishes a structure for display of financial information in the Estimates and reporting to Parliament via RPPs and DPRs. When displaying planned spending, RPPs rely on the Estimates as a basic source of financial information. </p>  <p>Main Estimates expenditure figures are based on the Annual Reference Level Update, which is prepared in the fall. In comparison, planned spending found in RPPs includes the Estimates as well as any other amounts that have been approved through a Treasury Board submission up to February 1st (See Definitions section). This readjusting of the financial figures allows for a more up-to-date portrait of planned spending by program.</p>

        <h4>Changes to the presentation of the Report on Plans and Priorities</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Several changes have been made to the presentation of the RPP partially to respond to a number of requests—from the House of Commons Standing Committees on Public Accounts (PAC—<a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Mode=1&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=3&amp;Language=E&amp;DocId=4653561&amp;File=0">Report 15</a>), in 2010; and on Government and Operations Estimates (OGGO—<a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=5690996&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=41&amp;Ses=1">Report 7</a>), in 2012—to provide more detailed financial and non-financial performance information about programs within RPPs and DPRs, thus improving the ease of their study to support appropriations approval.</p>  <ul> 
 <li>In Section II, financial, human resources and performance information is now presented at the program and sub-program levels for more granularity.</li> 
 <li>The report’s general format and terminology have been reviewed for clarity and consistency purposes.</li> 
 <li>Other efforts aimed at making the report more intuitive and focused on Estimates information were made to strengthen alignment with the Main Estimates. </li> 
</ul>

        <h4>How to read this document</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>RPPs are divided into four sections:</p>  <h5>Section I: Organizational Expenditure Overview</h5>  <p>This section allows the reader to get a general glance at the organization. It provides a description of the organization’s purpose, as well as basic financial and human resources information. This section opens with the new Organizational Profile, which displays general information about the department, including the names of the minister and the deputy head, the ministerial portfolio, the year the department was established, and the main legislative authorities. This subsection is followed by a new subsection entitled Organizational Context, which includes the Raison d’être, the Responsibilities, the Strategic Outcomes and Program Alignment Architecture, the Organizational Priorities and the Risk Analysis. This section ends with the Planned Expenditures, the Alignment to Government of Canada Outcomes, the Estimates by Votes and the Contribution to the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy. It should be noted that this section does not display any non-financial performance information related to programs (please see Section II).</p>  <h5>Section II: Analysis of Programs by Strategic Outcome</h5>  <p>This section provides detailed financial and non-financial performance information for strategic outcomes, programs and sub-programs. This section allows the reader to learn more about programs by reading their respective description and narrative entitled “Planning Highlights.” This narrative speaks to key services or initiatives which support the plans and priorities presented in Section I; it also describes how performance information supports the department’s strategic outcome or parent program.</p>  <h5>Section III: Supplementary Information</h5>  <p>This section provides supporting information related to departmental plans and priorities. In this section, the reader will find future-oriented statement of operations and a link to supplementary information tables regarding transfer payments, as well as information related to the greening government operations, internal audits and evaluations, horizontal initiatives, user fees, major Crown and transformational projects, and up-front multi-year funding, where applicable to individual organizations. The reader will also find a link to the <em>Tax Expenditures and Evaluations Report</em>, produced annually by the Minister of Finance, which provides estimates and projections of the revenue impacts of federal tax measures designed to support the economic and social priorities of the Government of Canada. </p>  <h5>Section IV: Organizational Contact Information </h5>  <p>In this last section, the reader will have access to organizational contact information.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>As Canada's Citizenship and Immigration Minister, I am pleased to present the 2014–2015 Report on Plans and Priorities for Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).</p>  <p>The Government of Canada is focused on creating jobs and opportunities by protecting the economy, keeping taxes low, and ensuring the health, safety and security of Canadians. Immigration remains central to that focus. The plans outlined in this report will ensure the immigration system fuels Canada's future prosperity, as we also maintain our generous family reunification and humanitarian record.</p>  <p>Once again this year, we plan to welcome between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents to Canada, an overall admissions range that has remained consistent since 2006, and represents the highest sustained level of immigration in Canadian history.</p>  <p>To meet the growing needs of Canada's work force in urban and rural communities, we are welcoming more immigrants in the economic category. Our government has stressed the importance of economic immigration in helping Canada recover from the effects of the global economic downturn of 2008–2009, and expects the need for economic immigration to increase for years to come. We plan to welcome 63% of newcomers via our economic immigration programs. This includes record levels for two of our most successful and fastest-growing programs: the Canadian Experience Class and the Provincial Nominee Program. </p>  <p>CIC will continue to pursue transformative changes to our policies and operations, bringing more speed and flexibility to the immigration system and better linking that system with Canada's evolving economic and labour market needs. As reaffirmed in the government's most recent Speech from the Throne, these changes will culminate in the introduction of a new active recruitment model in January 2015 that will support the selection of immigrants based on the skills that Canadian employers need which will lead to economic success. </p>  <p>Building on our National Settlement Conference in the fall of 2013, we are planning improvements to our integration and settlement systems. A particular focus is on finding innovative ways to begin the settlement process overseas, before immigrants arrive in Canada.</p>  <p>We are working toward fulfilling another commitment in the Speech from the Throne: to complete reforms to the Temporary Foreign Worker Program. These reforms will ensure Canadians are considered first for available jobs and support Canadian economic interests, including international agreements and partnerships.</p>  <p>We will continue to move forward with our Action Plan for Faster Family Reunification, which will reunite families more quickly while reducing backlogs and improving processing times. </p>  <p>Our refugee program will remain one of the most generous on earth. The new asylum system that came into effect in December 2012 will continue to provide genuine refugees with timelier protection, as it curtails abuse of the system. With a large drop in asylum claims from designated countries of origin that do not normally produce refugees, we will be able to devote more resources to refugee claimants who truly need Canada's protection.</p>  <p>CIC's work with our international partners, particularly the United States, will remain an important focus. We will continue to work with our American partners, in particular, to make biometric information sharing a reality. Also, as part of the <em>Beyond the Border Action Plan</em>, we will be establishing a common Canada-U.S. approach to screening travellers before they reach our shores via the Electronic Travel Authorization program, and recording the entry and exit of travellers crossing the North American borders.</p>  <p>The <em>Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act</em>, tabled in February 2014, represents the first comprehensive reforms to the <em>Citizenship Act</em> in more than a generation. Once implemented, these reforms will strengthen the value of Canadian citizenship, protect against fraud, and increase efficiencies throughout the citizenship Program. They will also support the integration of new citizens and ensure they are better prepared to participate fully in Canadian life. </p>  <p>CIC is dedicated to ensuring our operations and client services are as modern and as efficient as possible, while maintaining program integrity. One highlight is our work to modernize the Passport Program. Following the transfer of responsibility from Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada in July 2013, CIC has been working with Service Canada to modernize the passport program in order to strengthen program security and integrity, improve accessibility, and increase program efficiency.</p>  <p>We also recently assumed operational responsibility for International Experience Canada, a program that allows young Canadians and foreign nationals to gain travel and work experience in each other's countries for up to two years. We will undertake an examination of International Experience Canada in the context of the broader review of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, and will increase awareness of the program among potential Canadian participants.</p>  <p>CIC will continue to promote an inclusive and multicultural society through public education initiatives and community engagement, and by maintaining the momentum of Canada's successful chairmanship of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in 2013–2014.</p>  <p>As Canada's Citizenship and Immigration Minister, I am proud of these plans and certain they benefit Canadian society, Canada's economy and newcomers who wish to call Canada home. </p>  <br>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>In the first years after Confederation, Canada's leaders had a powerful vision: to connect Canada by rail and make the West the world's breadbasket as a foundation for the country's economic prosperity. This vision meant quickly populating the Prairies, leading the Government of Canada to establish its first national immigration policies. Immigrants have been a driving force in Canada's nationhood and its economic prosperity—as farmers settling lands, as workers in factories fuelling industrial growth, as entrepreneurs and as innovators helping Canada to compete in the global, knowledge-based economy.</p>

         <p><a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/">Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)</a> selects foreign nationals as permanent and temporary residents and offers Canada's protection to refugees. The Department develops Canada's admissibility policy, which sets the conditions for entering and remaining in Canada; it also conducts, in collaboration with its partners, the screening of potential permanent and temporary residents to protect the health, safety and security of Canadians. Fundamentally, the Department builds a stronger Canada by helping immigrants and refugees settle and integrate into Canadian society and the economy, and by encouraging and facilitating Canadian citizenship. To achieve this, CIC&nbsp;operates 27 in-Canada points of service and 70 points of service in 63 countries.</p>  <p>CIC's broad mandate is partly derived from the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-29.4/index.html">Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act</a></em>. The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration Canada is responsible for the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-29/index.html">Citizenship Act</a></em> of 1977 and shares responsibility with the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness for IRPA, which came into force following major legislative reform in 2002. CIC and the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/">Canada Border Services Agency</a> support their respective ministers in the administration and enforcement of IRPA. These organizations work collaboratively to achieve and balance the objectives of the immigration and refugee programs.</p>  <p>In October 2008, responsibility for administration of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-18.7"><em>Canadian Multiculturalism Act</em></a> was transferred to CIC from the <a href="http://www.pch.gc.ca/">Department of Canadian Heritage</a>. Under the Act, CIC promotes the integration of individuals and communities into all aspects of Canadian society and helps to build a stronger, more cohesive society. Jurisdiction over immigration is a shared responsibility between the federal and the provincial and territorial governments under section 95 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-1.html"><em>Constitution Act</em>, <em>1867</em></a>.</p>  <p>In July 2013, the primary responsibility for the <a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=739609">Passport Program</a> was transferred from <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/international/index.aspx?lang=eng">Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD)</a> to CIC, while passport service delivery will be provided through <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/goc/passport.shtml">Service Canada</a>.</p>  <p>In August 2013, CIC assumed the responsibility for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/international-experience-canada-moving-citizenship-immigration-canada.html">International Experience Canada (IEC) – archived</a> from DFATD. This transfer allowed the program to better align with government priorities and labour market demands in Canada by linking IEC to other immigration programs.</p>

  <tr> 
   <td colspan="3" headers="op-po2.4"><p><strong>Why is this a priority?</strong></p> <p>It is essential that CIC builds on its progress to advance the modernization agenda and improve the client experience to maximize the performance and competitiveness of Canada’s immigration program. CIC is making progress toward better managing our contact with clients by progressively offering more and more e-services. This will ensure that Canada remains competitive with other countries and attractive to potential applicants. This shift to e-services also can improve service while reducing the costs per transaction through process streamlining and automation. The Department has also continued to respond to various challenges, including large application backlogs, demands for improved efficiency and effectiveness of services, and improved program fraud detection by capitalizing on new technology and work processes.</p> <p><strong>Plans for meeting the priority</strong></p> <p>In accordance with the Government of Canada’s strategy to align programs and services, the responsibilities of <a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=739609">Passport Program</a> and IEC have been transferred to CIC. The Department is already responsible for determining and verifying Canadian citizenship, which is a requirement to apply for a passport, and integrating the Passport Program into CIC is expected to facilitate the process.</p> <p>The transition of the Passport Program to CIC was done without any service disruptions to Canadians. Now the focus is to stabilize and formalize the partnership with <a href="../../../../employment-social-development.html">Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)</a> and DFATD through the completion of the second Order in Council and new memorandums of understanding and service-level agreements. In parallel, significant energy and work to transform and modernize the way passports are delivered to Canadians has begun, and authorities to proceed with the modernization of the Passport Program have been approved.</p> <p>IEC is intended to give Canadian and non-Canadian participants opportunities to develop a mutual understanding of other cultures through travel, life and work experiences abroad and in Canada. This cultural experience also enhances their personal and professional development, giving them a competitive edge in the job market. With the support of DFATD, CIC will propose a renewed mandate for IEC that would better align the program with government priorities and labour market considerations. The Department will examine how best to integrate IEC within CIC’s program management and delivery, seeking opportunities to streamline operations and eliminate duplication of functions and processes. The move of IEC to CIC is a great opportunity to improve the client experience by taking advantage of the existing expertise within the Department and streamlining the application process for participants.</p> <p>With all these changes, CIC has been moving toward an increasingly integrated, modernized and centralized working environment. The 2015 modernization goals have been well advanced and have brought about several changes to its programs and service delivery networks both in Canada and abroad. However, the use of new technology and the addition of new programs have exposed gaps in client service. The Department has placed a particular focus on client service improvement to address the issues in service delivery by establishing a client service vision and strategy. </p> <p>In an effort to determine whether clients are satisfied with CIC’s level of service and to evaluate the impact of efforts to improve and modernize service, CIC will conduct a client service evaluation survey. Furthermore, the Department will examine how to provide clients with a centralized channel to submit complaints, comments and compliments to help identify systemic service issues and areas needing improvement.</p> <p>Upgraded technology will continue to allow CIC to provide its clients with the ease and convenience of self-service through its website, a suite of e-services and paperless processing. Recent and upcoming initiatives will enable the Department to provide clients new service delivery channels and to ensure their compatibility with different forms of technology, such as smart phones, to make services more accessible. Moreover, new technology will allow the Department to more effectively leverage the global network of expertise and distribute workload based on capacity, risk and complexity.</p> <p>In particular, the Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) system is an important innovation&nbsp;in the way CIC processes and manages temporary resident immigration applications, as it incorporates automated decision-making for the first time in the immigration context. The eTA program is on track for implementation in April 2015. The eTA is intended, designed and funded to be a system that is ‘light-touch’ and aimed at a low-risk population. It and other new and planned technologies are moving CIC in a direction that could radically shift its future approach to managing migration and screening travellers in a more efficient and client-friendly manner. Ultimately, the objective is to leverage technologies to enable greater bona fide traveller facilitation to Canada.</p> <p>The need to create a new and innovative immigration system that includes a pool of skilled workers who are ready to begin employment in Canada has been identified in Canada’s <a href="http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/economic-action-plan-2013">Economic Action Plan 2013</a>. A cornerstone of this modernized immigration program is the Expression of Interest (EOI) application management system which will enable active recruitment of highly skilled immigrants based on economic need. EOI will enable the Department to better respond to labour market needs, improve its ability to manage application intake and provide more timely and efficient service to clients.</p> </td>

         <p>In 2014–2015, CIC will continue to advance extensive changes to create a modern and dynamic immigration system. Fast and flexible, it will respond effectively to Canada’s labour market needs, support reunification of families and provide protection to refugees. To deliver on these goals, CIC maintains an Integrated Risk Management Framework that it uses to develop risk management strategies and to continually identify, update and monitor risks that could potentially affect the achievement of the Department’s strategic objectives.</p>  <h5>Developing a more demand-driven economic immigration program</h5>  <p>CIC’s strategic directions, as well as its policies and operations, are influenced by numerous external factors such as emerging events, the Canadian and global economic, social and political contexts, and shifting migration trends.</p>  <p>The current global economic outlook is stable but weak, and many countries continue to struggle with persistently high levels of youth unemployment. Although population aging may generate significant demand for labour that would result in declining youth unemployment, youth unemployment will persist in developing nations without economic growth. Strong emerging economies, in addition to established immigrant-receiving countries, are beginning to compete with Canada by attracting and retaining talent. These countervailing trends make immigration flows to Canada difficult to predict.</p>  <p>Canada continues to face its own demographic and labour market challenges. Economic recovery has been slow at the national level with significant differences across provinces. There are signs of tightening labour markets in the western provinces now and potential labour shortages in the future. Within this context CIC must pursue policies that support economic recovery while protecting Canadian workers.</p>  <p>CIC will help employers find foreign workers with the appropriate skills and training more quickly. With the introduction of the EOI system in January 2015, Canada will improve application management for the economic stream, avoid future backlogs and accelerate processing times. EOI will help CIC transition from passive processing of applications in the order they are received to a system that selects in-demand people with the skills that more closely match the labour market demand, which in turn will help immigrants succeed in Canada faster than ever before. CIC will continue working with provinces and territories, as well as with employers, to ensure the new system is streamlined and addresses labour market needs. In addition, steps will be taken to ensure immigrants have the opportunity to fully participate in Canada’s labour market by continuing to provide language training and advancing the <a href="http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/credential_recognition/foreign/framework.shtml">Pan-Canadian Framework for the Assessment and Recognition of Foreign Qualifications</a>.</p>  <p>As outlined in the <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/photo-gallery/speech-throne-seizing-canadas-moment">October 2013 Speech from the Throne</a>, and the <a href="http://www.budget.gc.ca/2014/home-accueil-eng.html?utm_source=GoC-Site&amp;utm_medium=Priority&amp;utm_term=English&amp;utm_campaign=Budget_2014">Economic Action Plan 2014</a>, CIC will reform the federal <a href="../../../services/immigrate-canada/investors.html">Immigrant Investor Program</a> to better support economic growth. To protect Canadian workers, CIC will also work with ESDC on ongoing changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program to ensure that employers consider qualified Canadian citizens and permanent residents first and that the TFW Program continues to support employers in meeting their short-term or acute labour market needs as originally intended.</p>  <h6 id="program_integrity"><em>Program Integrity</em></h6>  <p>Fraud prevention is an ongoing challenge in immigration and citizenship programs. CIC has implemented two acts to protect program integrity in recent years. The <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2012_17/page-1.html">Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act</a></em> has made it easier to prosecute smugglers and deter participation in human smuggling activities. The <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2013_16/FullText.html">Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act</a></em> limits the review mechanisms for foreign nationals and permanent residents who are inadmissible on such grounds as serious criminality. It also provides for the denial of temporary resident status to foreign nationals based on national or public interest or to avoid harming Canada’s international reputation. But as program integrity is strengthened, unscrupulous individuals develop more sophisticated means of gaining illegal entry to Canada. CIC will strengthen program integrity by eliminating loopholes, deterring and punishing fraud, and reducing systemic inefficiencies.</p>  <p>In 2014–2015 specific actions will be taken to attach even greater meaning and value to Canadian citizenship. Citizenship is devalued by those who do not intend to establish in Canada, including citizens of convenience. The Government of Canada introduced comprehensive reforms to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-29/">Citizenship Act</a></em> in Bill C-24,<em> <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=6410225&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;File=24">Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act</a></em> to ensure those who receive citizenship have a genuine attachment to Canada and are prepared to exercise the responsibilities of citizenship.</p>  <h6 id="natural_disasters"><em>Natural Disasters/Emerging Events</em></h6>  <p>CIC must be prepared to respond in emergencies, both domestically and abroad. International crises lead to unpredictable migration flows that may require Canada’s intervention and specialized supports for resettlement. Security risks like terrorism constantly threaten Canadians’ health and safety, and the flow of goods and people, public confidence, and international relationships. Therefore, the Department will work to maintain and improve its emergency response plans and procedures to respond efficiently and effectively to reduce the impact on operations when emergencies arise. CIC will continue to review and develop flexible policies and procedures to ensure a timely and coordinated emergency response for unexpected world events that could affect CIC’s program delivery.</p>  <h6 id="service_delivery"><em>Program and Service Delivery</em></h6>  <p>CIC continues to execute a dynamic, evolving strategic agenda. Since 2006, CIC has embarked on one of the most ambitious reform agendas in its history. By leveraging technology, CIC is moving from a paper-based and overseas mission-centric network to a responsive and competitive global operational model that distributes the workload evenly. Many parts of the agenda have already been put in place. For example, <a href="../../mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions.html">Ministerial Instructions</a> have been introduced to better and more quickly align immigration with Canada’s evolving needs; over the past several years the number of avenues for economic immigrants has increased with the introduction of the Canadian Experience Class and the FSTP; and clients are able to access improved self-service options through integrated voice response and CIC’s website. While these efforts have gone a long way toward modernizing and strengthening the immigration system, there is still much to be done in terms of implementing new initiatives, such as the online eTA system, and identifying opportunities to streamline and update current processes. Sound project management practices are in place to manage all of these changes and ensure that clients will continue to benefit from the full suite of CIC’s programs and services, from visitor visas to citizenship renewals, during this transition.</p>  <h6 id="partnership_mgt"><em>Partnership Management</em></h6>  <p>Provinces, territories, other federal government departments, service provider organizations and other public stakeholders are active participants in the success of Canada’s immigration continuum. Together with provinces and territories, CIC will advance the shared <a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=707339">Federal-Provincial-Territorial Vision Action Plan</a> announced in November 2012 to improve outcomes and to share the benefits of immigrations across the country. The complexity of the immigration and settlement systems means that decisions made by CIC or any of its partners or stakeholders can significantly affect relationships, performance results and the ability to meet objectives for all stakeholders. Yet, the private sector (academics, service providers, non-governmental organizations) offers an untapped opportunity to reduce inconsistent supports and outcomes across jurisdictions. Over the coming year, CIC will explore ways to leverage these partnerships, for example, opportunities for collaborative work with employers and community partners to enhance program efficiencies and immigrant outcomes.</p>  <p>In ever-changing external and internal environments with finite resources, rapid technological change and growing public scrutiny, CIC faces an increasing demand to become even better at anticipating and managing risks, both within the Department and for Canadians. CIC must remain diligent in effectively managing its resources to achieve its strategic outcomes and operational objectives, while minimizing exposure to a variety of risks. </p>

         <p>Overall, the Department's planned spending will decrease from current levels to $1,320.5 million in 2016–2017. This decrease is largely due to declining statutory funding to return fees for terminated applications. During this period, spending also decreases as a result of planned reductions in funding for the Toronto 2015 Pan Am/Parapan Am Games and the eTA system.</p>

The section also provides details on each program, such as the expected results, performance indicators, targets, planning highlights, and the related financial and non-financial resources. The systematic collection, interpretation and analysis of performance measurement results is a key annual activity and enables the Department to report on expected results through the Departmental Performance Report and to broadly use performance information across the organization to inform decision making.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>CIC plays a significant role in fostering Canada’s economic development. By promoting Canada as a destination of choice for innovation, investment and opportunity, CIC encourages talented individuals to come to Canada and to contribute to our prosperity. Canada’s immigration program is based on non-discriminatory principles—foreign nationals are assessed without regard to race, nationality, ethnic origin, colour, religion or gender. Those who are selected to immigrate to Canada have the skills, education, language competencies and work experience to make an immediate economic contribution.</p>  <p>CIC’s efforts, whether through policy and program development or processing applications for the Federal Skilled Workers Program, the Quebec Skilled Workers Program, the Provincial Nominees Program or other programs, attract thousands of qualified permanent residents each year. Under the 2008 amendments to IRPA the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration Canada has the authority to issue instructions establishing priorities for processing certain categories of applications. In that regard, the Department analyses and monitors its programs to ensure they are responsive to emerging labour market needs.</p>  <p>CIC also facilitates the hiring of foreign nationals by Canadian employers on a temporary basis and implements a number of initiatives to attract and retain international students.</p>

        <h4>Benefits for Canadians</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Immigration continues to have a significant influence on Canadian society and economic development. Permanent residents who arrive in Canada every year enhance Canada’s social fabric, contribute to labour market growth and strengthen the economy. Changes that modernize and improve the immigration system not only strengthen the integrity of the Permanent Economic Residents Program but also benefit Canada by targeting skills Canadian employers need and admitting qualified individuals more quickly.</p>  <p>Temporary foreign workers help generate growth for a number of Canadian industries by meeting short-term and acute needs in the labour market that are not easily filled by the domestic labour force. International students contribute economically as consumers and enrich the fabric of Canadian society through their diverse experiences and talents. Some temporary workers and international students represent a key talent pool to be retained as immigrants.</p>

         <p>Rooted in objectives outlined in the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a></em> (IRPA), the focus of this program is on the selection and processing of immigrants who can support the development of a strong and prosperous Canada, in which the benefits of immigration are shared across all regions of Canada. The acceptance of qualified permanent residents helps the government meet its economic objectives, such as building a skilled work force, addressing immediate and longer-term labour market needs, and supporting national and regional labour force growth.

 <li>Manage application intake, wait times and inventories while improving responsiveness to labour market conditions and attaining targeted economic objectives through the use of <a href="../../mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions.html">Ministerial Instructions</a>, where appropriate.</li> 
 <li>Proceed toward the January 2015, launch of the Expression of Interest (EOI) system, which will contribute to a fast, flexible, labour market-responsive immigration system that meets employer needs: Identified as a priority in the October 2013 <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/photo-gallery/speech-throne-seizing-canadas-moment">Speech from the Throne</a>, EOI is not a new immigration program but enables active recruitment and faster processing in economic immigration categories.</li> 
 <li>Drawing on the example of systems successfully used in Australia and New Zealand, the EOI model prescreens candidates for skilled immigration and invites applications only from top candidates whose skills best meet the country’s economic needs.</li> 
 <li>To strengthen the immigration system’s labour market responsiveness, EOI gives employers a greater role in the recruitment, assessment and selection of skilled immigrants. CIC is partnering with <a href="../../../../employment-social-development.html">Employment and Social Development Canada</a> (ESDC) to allow employers—as part of ESDC’s modernization efforts—to effectively source EOI candidates through its Job Bank. Candidates will receive job postings tailored to their skills and employers will receive information regarding the candidates with skills that they need. In addition, CIC will work with the private sector, particularly existing job sites, to facilitate as many opportunities as possible for EOI candidates to be identified by employers.</li> 
 <li>In the coming months, EOI will be the subject of a concerted outreach campaign by CIC and the provinces and territories to gain employer perspectives on system design and implementation and ensure prospective immigrants, employers and other stakeholders are able to make best use of the system at launch. CIC will also work with ESDC on labour market information to inform future sets of Ministerial Instructions and the EOI application management system.</li> 
 <li>As a result, the launch of EOI will move Canada from the passive receipt of skilled immigrant applications to an active approach to recruitment and up-front screening, complemented by faster application processing times to ensure labour market demand is met. </li> 
</ul>  <h5 id="a2.1.1.1">Sub-program 1.1.1: Federal Skilled Workers</h5>  <p>The Federal Skilled Workers Program is the Government of Canada’s main selection system for skilled immigration. The goal of the program is to select highly skilled immigrants who will make a long-term contribution to Canada’s national and structural labour market needs, in support of a strong and prosperous Canadian economy. The program uses a points system to identify prospective immigrants with the ability to economically establish in Canada, based on their human capital (education, skilled work experience, language skills, etc.), with a minimum language threshold and a third-party foreign educational credential assessment prior to application. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.1.1.5">Sub-program 1.1.5: Live-in Caregivers</h5>  <p>The Live-in Caregivers Program (LCP) allows persons residing in Canada to employ qualified foreign workers in private residences to provide care for children, elderly persons or persons with a disability. Eligible applicants come to Canada as temporary foreign workers, subject to their employer obtaining a neutral or positive labour market opinion (LMO) from ESDC. The LMO considers whether a Canadian or permanent resident is available and the wage and working conditions being offered. The critical component of the program distinguishing it from the general pool of temporary foreign workers is the requirement for the caregiver to reside in their place of employment. The program is also unique in that foreign workers arriving in Canada under the program are eligible to apply for permanent residence after two years or 3,900 hours of full-time employment within four years of their arrival in Canada. They are granted permanent residence as part of the live-in caregiver category of the Economic Class, with established room under the annual levels plan. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants. </p>

The program is complementary to the Federal Skilled Workers Program but uses simplified criteria, including eligible skilled Canadian work experience and a minimum level of proficiency in English or French. The program provides a streamlined and usually faster route to permanent residence for those who have already established themselves in skilled work in Canada. This allows Canada to retain talented workers who have already contributed to the Canadian economy.

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.1.2.1">Sub-program 1.2.1: International Students</h5>  <p>CIC supports a range of goals for immigration by managing the entry of international students to Canada. International students contribute to Canada’s educational and international competitiveness, and strengthen our educational institutions. International students are selected by these institutions according to their criteria, and CIC validates their presence in Canada to work and study by issuing study permits and, where necessary, visas, which allow them to obtain a Canadian education. CIC is responsible for ensuring that the proper documentation, financial and security requirements are met, including the bona fides, or honest intentions, of all applicants. In order to provide the opportunity of the benefit of Canadian work experience, work permits are issued to qualified international students under CIC’s On-Campus, Off-Campus and Co-op/Internship Work Permit components. Students who want to work in Canada after graduation can apply for a work permit under the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) component, which allows them to gain up to three years of valuable Canadian work experience. Some PGWP holders of work permits will also be eligible to apply for permanent residence under the Canadian Experience Class or other programs. The selection and processing involve the issuance of temporary resident visas and study permits to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.1.2.2">Sub-program 1.2.2: Temporary Foreign Workers</h5>  <p>The Temporary Foreign Workers (TFW) Program allows employers to hire foreign nationals on a temporary basis. The program contributes to the competitiveness and viability of Canadian businesses, since workers are recruited by employers or agencies to address labour or skill supply shortages. The federal government’s role is to manage the entry of foreign nationals to work, scrutinizing the job offer to ensure it is both consistent with our goals for economic immigration and has a neutral or positive effect on the Canadian labour market. In fulfilling this role, in order to hire a temporary worker some employers may require an LMO from Employment and Social Development Canada, which considers whether a Canadian or permanent resident is available and the wage and working conditions being offered. Once in possession of the LMO (if required), the applicant may then apply for the work permit at a mission abroad, at the port of entry (if eligible) or inside Canada (if eligible). The foreign national must meet all admissibility and eligibility requirements. There are a number of different streams under the TFW Program. One of these is the LCP, which allows persons residing in Canada to employ qualified foreign nationals to live and work in their private residence to provide care for children, the elderly and the disabled. The Seasonal Agricultural Worker component enables the hiring of workers from countries with these agreements with Canada. If an LMO is not required, such as for reciprocal employment exchanges, intra-company transfers, international agreements (including the <em>North American Free Trade Agreement</em>, bilateral youth exchange agreements and other exceptions), the foreign national applies directly to CIC for a work permit and visa, and CIC considers the genuineness of the job offer and ensures the foreign national meets all admissibility and eligibility requirements. The selection and processing involve the issuance of temporary resident visas and work permits to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>

         <p>CIC is committed to upholding Canada’s humanitarian tradition of reuniting families, resettling refugees and providing protection to those in need.</p>  <p>The Family Class, as set forth in IRPA, allows permanent residents and Canadian citizens to sponsor their immediate family members (i.e., their spouse, common-law or conjugal partner, and dependent children), as well as&nbsp;parents and grandparents, for immigration to Canada. The permanent resident or Canadian citizen must undertake to provide for the basic needs of&nbsp;their sponsored relative&nbsp;for a set period of time, depending on the nature of the relationship. This program&nbsp;facilitates family reunification while ensuring that there is no undue cost to the general public.</p>  <p>As a signatory to the <em><a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsII.aspx?&amp;src=UNTSONLINE&amp;mtdsg_no=V~2&amp;chapter=5&amp;Temp=mtdsg2&amp;lang=en">1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a></em>, the <em><a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ShowMTDSGDetails.aspx?src=UNTSONLINE&amp;tabid=2&amp;mtdsg_no=V-5&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en#Participants">1967 Protocol</a></em>, and the <em><a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a></em>, and further to provisions set forth in the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a></em>, Canada has international and domestic legal obligations to provide safe haven to individuals in need of protection. Canada meets these obligations through the in-Canada refugee status determination system. In addition, Canada partners&nbsp;with other countries and with international and civil society organizations to come to the aid of individuals in need of protection through resettlement. Every year, Canada resettles 10,000 to 12,000—or one out of every 10—of the refugees resettled globally. CIC engages both domestic and international stakeholders to develop and implement timely, efficient and effective refugee protection policies and programs.</p>

The sponsor, who is a permanent resident or Canadian citizen, is responsible for providing the basic needs of his or her spouse or partner for three years, and for their dependent children for up to 10 years. Processing involves determining the sponsor’s ability to meet the sponsorship obligations and verifying the bona fides of the relationships.

This program makes it possible for Canadian citizens and permanent residents to be reunited with their extended family members, while ensuring that there is no undue cost to the general public. Sponsors must demonstrate that they can meet their sponsorship obligations, which include providing for the basic needs of their parents and grandparents for 10 years. Particular sponsorship requirements and a lower processing priority distinguish this category from the spouses, partners and dependent children category. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.2.2.4">Sub-program 2.2.4: In-Canada Asylum</h5>  <p>Flowing from Canada’s international and domestic legal obligations, Canada’s asylum system provides protection to persons fleeing persecution and risk of torture, risk to life, or risk of cruel treatment or punishment, by way of legislative and regulatory measures that enable Canada to meet those obligations. The program establishes fair and efficient procedures that uphold Canada’s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings, while maintaining the overall integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system. Canada’s asylum system includes the determination of eligibility for referral to the IRB and the granting of protected person status to those determined by the Board to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. When appropriate, the system also provides for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) to failed refugee claimants and others facing removal from Canada.</p>

Ultimately, the goal of integration is to encourage newcomers to be fully engaged in the economic, social, political and cultural life of Canada. CIC’s Settlement Program assists immigrants and refugees to overcome barriers specific to the newcomer experience, such as a lack of official language skills, limited knowledge of Canada and the recognition of foreign credentials. The program provides language learning services for newcomers, community and employment bridging services, settlement information, and support services that facilitate access to settlement programming. Also, through the Foreign Credentials Referral Office, the program provides information, path-finding and referral services to internationally trained individuals to have their credentials assessed quickly so they can find work in the fields in which they have been trained. Most services are designed and delivered by service provider organizations; however, certain services (such as information provision) are delivered directly by CIC in Canada and overseas.</p>

The compensation to Quebec covers services for reception services and linguistic, cultural and economic integration services, provided that they are equivalent to similar federal services in other parts of the country. An objective of the <em>Accord</em> is, among other things, the preservation of Quebec's demographic importance within Canada and the integration of immigrants into that province in a manner that respects the distinct identity of Quebec. The <em>Accord</em> provides Quebec with exclusive responsibility for the selection of immigrants destined to the province (except for family reunification and asylum seekers in Canada) as well as the reception and linguistic and cultural integration of these immigrants (including resettlement of refugees). Under the <em>Accord</em>, Canada is responsible for defining overall immigration objectives, national levels, admissibility, selecting family category and asylum seekers in Canada, and citizenship. This program uses transfer payment funding from the grant for the <em>Canada-Quebec Accord on Immigration</em>.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.3.1.3">Sub-program 3.1.3: Immigration Loan</h5>  <p>The Immigration Loan Program is a statutory program under IRPA. It ensures that some persons, otherwise unable to pay for the costs of transportation to Canada and medical admissibility exams, have access to a funding source. Assistance loans may also be approved for newcomers in need to cover initial settlement expenses such as rental and utilities deposits. The main target groups for the program are GARs and privately sponsored refugees. These individuals have undergone extreme hardship and most often have few personal resources and are therefore unable to access traditional lending institutions. Canadian visa officers authorize the transportation and admissibility loans and the <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home.html">International Organization for Migration</a> arranges travel and medical exams for refugees and pays these costs. CIC reimburses them and the refugee reimburses CIC. Assistance loans are authorized by in-Canada officers. The interest-bearing loans are repayable in full and payment plans vary by the value of the loan and the recipients' ability to repay while integrating.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.3.2.2">Sub-program 3.2.2: Citizenship Acquisition, Confirmation and Revocation</h5>  <p>Citizenship processing activities include interpreting and administering the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-29/">Citizenship Act</a></em> and Regulations, managing the naturalization process (whereby non-citizens become citizens), issuing proof of citizenship to those who are citizens by birth or by naturalization, and maintaining these records. The processing of Canadian citizenship helps newcomers fully participate in Canadian life and contributes to their successful integration into Canadian society. A person's citizenship is revoked if it is found that they have obtained their citizenship fraudulently, by misrepresentation or by knowingly concealing information during the course of their immigration or citizenship application process. CIC reviews files where there are allegations of fraud, and collects and analyses information to determine if a recommendation to initiate revocation proceedings should be made to the Minister.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The Multiculturalism Program is the principal means of carrying out the Minister's responsibilities under the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-18.7/">Canadian Multiculturalism Act</a></em> for promoting the full and equitable participation of individuals and communities across Canada. Grants and contributions to not-for-profit organizations, the private sector, provincial and municipal governments, non-federal public institutions, and individuals seek to advance overarching program objectives. These objectives are to: build an integrated, socially cohesive society (through increasing intercultural and interfaith understanding, civic memory and pride, respect for core democratic values, and equality of opportunity to full participation in society and the economy); improve the responsiveness of institutions to the needs of a diverse population; and actively engage in discussions on multiculturalism, integration and diversity at the international level. Direct public outreach and promotional activities by the program primarily target young people. Further, the program assists federal partners to meet their obligations under the Act through its annual report to Parliament on its operation and the federal Multiculturalism Champions Network. It also engages with non-federal public institutions seeking to respond to diversity through the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Officials Responsible for Multiculturalism Issues. The program is the locus for Canada's participation in international agreements and institutions with respect to anti-Semitism and Holocaust remembrance (through the <a href="http://www.holocaustremembrance.com/">International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance</a>).</p>

         <p>Canada welcomes thousands of permanent residents, temporary foreign workers, international students and visitors each year. CIC manages the movement of people within the context of a more responsive immigration system that benefits Canada's economic, social and cultural development while at the same time protecting the health, safety and security of all Canadians. To manage health issues related to immigration, CIC develops and implements risk mitigation strategies in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/">Public Health Agency of Canada</a>, provinces and territories, and partner countries. Any residual public health risks regarding the transmission of infectious diseases are mitigated through medical surveillance of newly arrived permanent and temporary residents as required. To protect Canadians—and to ensure that the benefits of a more responsive immigration system are not undermined—CIC works with the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/">Canada Border Services Agency</a>, the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> and the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> to conduct appropriate background screening of both immigrants and temporary residents and to identify applicants who could pose a security risk to the country. CIC shares information with these organizations, fostering timely and effective delivery of its program.</p>  <p> Internationally, migration and humanitarian issues continue to gain the attention of governments, bilateral and multilateral forums, non-governmental organizations, and academic and other research institutes. CIC plays an important role in framing and advancing&nbsp;international dialogues on migration and integration policy, refugee protection and&nbsp;governance. These dialogues explore the links between migration policy and development assistance, health, the environment, trade, and the movement of human capital.&nbsp;CIC works to develop and implement a strategic agenda on global migration and&nbsp;refugee protection, and to advance Canada's policy and program priorities.</p>

        <h4>Benefits for Canadians</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p> Growing international migration has increased the possibility of Canadians being exposed to disease outbreaks and infectious diseases. CIC and its partners in health management work to reduce the impact of identified risks on the Canadian population.</p>  <p>Policies and programs that affect the international movement of people—across Canada's borders and outside them—have a direct bearing on the safety and security of Canada and Canadians at large, whether they are at home or travelling and conducting trade abroad. Strengthening Canada's refugee programs and demonstrating continued leadership in refugee protection, human rights and the promotion of cultural diversity through active participation in various international and regional forums and partnerships support Canada's broader contribution to a safe and secure world. Finally, coordinated and responsible sharing of information supports a fast response to threats to the safety and security of Canadians.</p>

         <p>This program aims to provide effective immigration health services to manage the health aspect of migrant access and settlement to Canada, and facilitate the arrival of resettled refugees to Canada and their integration while contributing to the protection of the health and safety of all Canadians and contributing to the maintenance of sustainable Canadian health and social services. The program aims to evaluate health risks related to immigration and coordinate with international and Canadian health partners to develop risk management strategies and processes to assess the health of applicants wishing to immigrate to Canada. The strategies, processes and interventions are intended to reduce the impact of the risks identified on the health of Canadians and on Canada's health and social services.</p>

The program offers five types of coverage: Expanded Health Coverage, Health-Care Coverage, Public Health or Public Safety Health-Care Coverage, coverage for the Immigration Medical Examination and coverage for detainees. Most beneficiaries receive Health-Care Coverage, which is a level of coverage similar to the coverage Canadians receive through their provincial/territorial health insurance plans. The program helps protect public health and public safety and supports the successful settlement of resettled refugees receiving government support. IFH Program beneficiaries with valid coverage access health services through registered health care providers, who are reimbursed directly by the IFH claims administrator for covered services. </p>

As such, in accordance with IRPA and accompanying regulations, CIC facilitates the travel of bona fide permanent residents, visitors, students and temporary workers while protecting the health, safety and security of Canadians by effectively managing migration access and controlling entry. This is accomplished through a variety of policy and operational measures, including visa policy interventions, anti-fraud measures, eligibility and admissibility criteria, negotiations of bilateral and multilateral information-sharing agreements and treaties, security updates to travel and immigration status documents, as well as revisions to identity management practices.

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.4.2.1">Sub-program 4.2.1: Permanent Resident Status Documents</h5>  <p>In accordance with IRPA, CIC must process and issue to all permanent residents a secure status document for travel purposes. The permanent resident card serves as proof of permanent resident status in Canada and may be easily verified by commercial carriers and border officers. While the permanent resident card also meets international travel document standards, it is not a travel document. The Permanent Resident Status Documents Program makes it difficult to access Canadian territory fraudulently. The program establishes a mechanism to verify compliance with the residency requirement, provides permanent residents with a status document confirming their right to live, work and study in Canada, provides permanent residents with access to government services, and enables them to be recognized and processed quickly at the border, thereby enhancing border security. While not mandatory within Canada, the permanent resident card is required for all permanent residents as proof of their status when seeking to re-enter Canada on a commercial carrier. It contains security features to reduce the risk of fraud. Permanent residents who obtained their status under previous immigration legislation or those who wish to replace an expired, lost or stolen permanent resident card may obtain one upon application. Limited use travel documents are also issued by visa offices overseas to qualified permanent residents outside of Canada who do not have a valid permanent resident card, to facilitate return travel to Canada.</p>

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.4.2.2">Sub-program 4.2.2: Visitors Status</h5>  <p>Under IRPA, all visitors to Canada require a temporary resident visa (TRV), except citizens of countries for which an exemption has been granted under the Regulations. A foreign national who wishes to come to Canada, and from a country for which a TRV is imposed, needs to apply at a Canadian embassy abroad prior to travelling to Canada. The Visitors Status Program aims to ensure that each applicant is screened to determine whether they meet the entry requirements, including that they will abide by the terms and conditions of entry, and are not inadmissible to Canada. The screening of travellers requiring a TRV is carried out by CIC in cooperation with its federal security partners. Once individuals arrive in Canada, their status needs to be maintained, regardless of whether they needed a visa to enter the country. The TRV is designed to prevent individuals who would abuse temporary entry from coming to Canada, and to facilitate the entry to Canada of genuine temporary residents. The requirement to obtain a TRV limits the number of immigration violations (e.g., refugee claims, no proper travel documents, not leaving Canada once the period of stay has expired, working illegally, etc.) and protects the health, safety and security of Canadians.</p>

In some cases, however, there may be compelling reasons for an officer to issue a temporary resident permit (TRP) to allow a person who is otherwise inadmissible to enter or remain in Canada. Under the TRP Program, designated officers may issue these permits abroad, at a port of entry or in Canada, depending on the circumstances. Grounds for issuance of a TRP include, among others, inadmissibility due to medical reasons, criminality, reasons of security, infringement of human or international rights, or organized crime. TRPs are issued for a limited, often short, period of time and are subject to cancellation at any time. TRPs provide officers with the flexibility to address exceptional circumstances and, in so doing, maintain the integrity of Canada's immigration program and protect the health, safety and security of Canadians.</p>

Program integrity is achieved through case processing procedures that identify and refuse status to applicants who fail to meet eligibility and/or admissibility requirements, including fraud, and through referral of these cases for enforcement action where appropriate. Identity management contributes to strengthened program integrity by ensuring that services are delivered to the correct individual, developing efficiencies across multiple business lines, and allowing CIC to streamline interactions with repeat clientele.

</ul>  <h5 id="a2.4.2.5">Sub-program 4.2.5: Global Assistance for Irregular Migrants</h5>  <p>The Global Assistance for Irregular Migrants (GAIM) Program provides transfer payments in the form of contributions to trusted international, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations (such as the <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home.html">International Organization for Migration</a>) to fund activities and support for intercepted irregular migrants, such as meeting basic needs, providing medical care, identifying migrants to be referred to the appropriate authorities for refugee status determination, and facilitating voluntary return and reintegration in the country of origin if determined not to be in need of protection. The GAIM Program responds to the need for Canada to have a permanent program to manage the consequences of disrupting human-smuggling activities believed to be destined for Canada. It is triggered when the Prime Minister's Special Advisor on Human Smuggling identifies an event involving these activities and CIC agrees to implement the program. It also addresses the need for complementary activities that demonstrate Canada's commitment to transit states and international partners that would otherwise be encumbered with the costs of unintended consequences arising from smuggling-prevention activities. Offers of capacity building and support in managing the consequences of successful prevention of human smuggling have been critical in securing bilateral cooperation from transit states. The GAIM Program reflects CIC's role in Canada's whole-of-government strategy to combat human-smuggling activities. The program uses transfer payment funding from the contribution in support of the GAIM Program.</p>

<p>The returning migrants who request assistance are first given a seminar by the implementing organization on how to identify business opportunities and to prepare a business plan. Once they submit a detailed business plan, the implementing organization reviews and works with the migrant to refine it. Once this is done the implementing organization provides funding (e.g., for tools and woodworking equipment for a carpentry business or downpayment for a truck for a transportation business) and other assistance (e.g., registering the business, help in finding premises, help in identifying suppliers, etc.) to start the business. All of this is done by the implementing organization using funds provided by CIC under GAIM.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>As part of its mandate, CIC aims to influence the international migration and integration policy agenda. This is done by developing and promoting, together with other public policy sectors, Canada's position on international migration, integration and refugee protection issues, and through participation in multilateral, regional and bilateral forums. CIC works closely with partner countries to ensure the effective administration of immigration laws through the exchange of information, including biometric data. This international migration policy development helps Canada advance its interests in the context of international migration as well as meet its international obligations and commitments. CIC supports international engagement and partnerships through membership in and contributions to such organizations as the <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home.html">International Organization for Migration</a>, Regional Conference on Migration, the UNHCR <a href="http://www.gfmd.org">Global Forum on Migration and Development</a>, and <a href="http://www.igc.ch/">Intergovernmental Consultations on Migration, Asylum and Refugees</a>. The program uses transfer payment funding from the following programs: grant for Migration Policy Development; International Organization for Migration; and International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.</p>

         <p>The total departmental expenses are expected to increase by $68 million or 3.0 percent from $2.29 billion in 2013–2014 to $2.36 billion in 2014–2015. This increase is attributable to the fact that CIC assumed responsibility for Passport Canada as of July 2, 2013. Only nine months of the Passport Program's expenses are included in CIC's estimated expenses for 2013–2014 versus a full 12 months in the <span class="nowrap">2014–2015</span> planned expenses. Transfer payments comprise the majority of planned expenses (41.2% or $973 million in 2014–2015).</p>  <p>The increase of $179 million in revenues from 2013–2014 to 2014–2015 is due to the fact that only nine months of the Passport Program's revenues are included in CIC's estimated revenues for 2013–2014 versus a full 12 months in the <span class="nowrap">2014–2015</span> planned revenues.</p>  <p>The chart below outlines CIC's planned expenses by program for 2014–2015: </p>
