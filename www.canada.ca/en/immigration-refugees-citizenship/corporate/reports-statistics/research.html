It examines the skill levels of recent and established immigrants in Canada and in an international context, and provides a detailed analysis of foundational skills relative to a variety of sociodemographic factors, such as age, gender, length of residency in Canada, and highest level of education completed, as well as immigration-specific factors, such as immigration category (refugee, family class, points system).</p>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2017390-eng.htm">Labour market outcomes of immigrant women who arrive as dependants of economic principal applicants</a></strong><p>Many immigrants come to Canada with spouses and dependants. Success in the labour market at the family level is not only important to the economic well-being of immigrants, but also critical to the overall contribution of immigration to the Canadian economy. This study looks at characteristics and labour market outcomes of women who arrived as spouses of economic principal applicants and compares them to those of other economic immigrants (male and female principal applicants and male spouses) and to those of married women who arrived in the family class.</p>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2016377-eng.htm">Educational and labour market outcomes of childhood immigrants by admission class</a></strong><p>The children of immigrants who arrived in Canada over the past several decades outperform their peers with Canadian-born parents in educational attainment overall, and the two groups have similar labour market outcomes. However, large variations by ethnicity or source country have been observed among the children of immigrants. This heterogeneity has been interpreted as the result of differences in vulnerability and resources between immigrant groups, in terms of individual and family socioeconomic background—particularly education and host-country language ability—and group cultural and community characteristics.</p>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2017397-eng.htm">Chronic low income among immigrants in Canada and its communities</a></strong><p>This paper examines the rate of chronic low income among immigrants aged 25 or older in Canada during the 2000s. Chronic low income is defined as having a family income under a low-income cut-off for five consecutive years or more. A regionally adjusted low-income measure is used for the analysis. Among immigrants who were in low income in any given year, about one-half were in chronic low income. The highest chronic rates were observed among immigrant seniors, as well as immigrants who were unattached or lone parents. There were large differences in the chronic low-income rate by immigrant place of birth, even after adjusting for differences in other immigrant background characteristics. The chronic low-income rate was lower among economic class immigrants than among family or refugee classes, but the difference was reduced after adjusting for background characteristics. Chronic low-income rates among immigrants varied significantly across the 29 cities/regions in the study, varying by a factor of 5 between the highest and lowest rates. However, the community ranking was not static and changed significantly between the beginning and end of the 2000s.</p>

(2014) <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/reports-statistics/research/statistical-portrait-french-speaking-immigrant-population-outside-quebec-1991-2011.html">Statistical Portrait of the French-speaking Immigrant Population Outside Quebec (1991-2011)</a>, IRCC: Ottawa. In these syntheses, the French-speaking immigrant population outside Quebec comprises two groups: those with only French as their first official language spoken (French FOLS) and those whose first official language spoken is both French and English (French-English FOLS).</p>

This study uses large national longitudinal data sets to examine cross-cohort trends and within-cohort changes in the earnings among three groups of young university graduates: immigrants who are former international students in Canada (Canadian-educated immigrants), foreign-educated immigrants, and the Canadian-born. The results show that Canadian-educated immigrants on average had much lower earnings than the Canadian-born but higher earnings than foreign-educated immigrants both in the short and long run. However, Canadian-educated immigrants are a highly heterogeneous group, and whether they held a well-paid job in Canada before becoming permanent residents is the key factor differentiating their post-immigration earnings relative to both the Canadian-born and foreign-educated immigrants. Furthermore, Canadian education minimizes the earnings variation by source-country quality of tertiary education, but mitigates little of the disadvantage of international students from countries where English is not the official language.</p>

Temporary foreign workers have also become an increasingly important source from which permanent residents are admitted to Canada. Using the Temporary Residents file and the Immigrant Landing File, this article documents the changes in the level and type of new temporary foreign workers arrived in Canada in 1990s and 2000s. It further examines the patterns of transition from temporary foreign workers to permanent residents, and the immigration classes through which temporary foreign workers obtained permanent residency.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/reports-statistics/research/push-pull-factors-related-student-retention-integration-quebec.html"><strong>Push-Pull Factors Related to Student Retention and Integration in Québec</strong></a><p>This study aimed to identify the principal factors that drive English-speaking youth including English-speaking international students and immigrants to remain in or leave the province upon the completion of their university education. We were concerned with the socioeconomic and linguistic factors that attract students to the province and contribute to the retention of these youth in the English-speaking community (ESC) of Quebec. Specifically, we examined English-speaking students’ initial motivations for studying and living in Quebec, what kind of support they obtained upon arrival and across their period of study, and the conditions that might motivate them to remain in the province upon the completion of their studies.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/reports-statistics/research/spousal-characteristics-selection-economic-immigrants.html"><strong>Spousal Characteristics and the Selection of Economic Immigrants</strong></a><p>A growing number of OECD countries have skilled immigration programs with a fundamental goal of selecting immigrants who will integrate quickly into the receiving country labour market and have labour market earnings that are commensurate with their human capital. While this policy goal has received considerable interest in the economics literature, far less attention has been devoted to the more specific question of whether to incorporate a married applicant’s spouse’s characteristics into the decision to admit a Principal Applicant (PA). This is surprising given that a number of immigrant point systems allocate points based on the characteristics of the applicant’s spouse. Incorporating spousal characteristics into immigrant selection rules raises a number of methodological issues that need to be considered when devising an optimal point system. To date, we are not aware of any attempts in the economic literature to analyze this topic.</p>

An exploration of ethno-cultural enclaves in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, in 2011</strong></a><p>Two patterns of enclave development are introduced at the outset of the report: enclaves as relatively monolithic social spaces where minority groups live in isolation from mainstream culture and each other (‘parallel lives’), versus enclaves as ‘super-diverse’ spaces that contain highly variegated populations. One of the important themes of this study is to determine which of these patterns better describes the social geography of Canada’s three largest immigrant reception cities, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2015368-eng.htm"><strong>Which Human Capital Characteristics Best Predict the Earnings of Economic Immigrants?</strong></a><p>While an extensive literature examines the association between immigrants' characteristics and their earnings in Canada, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the relative importance of various human capital factors, such as language, work experience and education when predicting the earnings of economic immigrants. The decline in immigrant earnings since the 1980s, which was concentrated among economic immigrants, prompted changes to the points system in the early 1990s and in 2002, in large part, to improve immigrant earnings. Knowledge of the relative role of various characteristics in determining immigrant earnings is important when making such changes. This paper addresses two questions. First, what is the relative importance of observable human capital factors when predicting earnings of economic immigrants (principal applicants), who are selected by the points system? Second, does the relative importance of these factors vary between the short, intermediate, and long terms?</p>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2016374-eng.htm">Changing Immigrant Characteristics and Entry Earnings</a></strong><p>Immigration selection policies changed significantly during the 1990s and 2000s, at least in part to improve immigrant entry earnings. After the decline in both relative (to the Canadian-born) and absolute entry earnings during the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a strong desire to improve the economic outcomes of immigrants shortly after their landing. Changes in selection policies and other factors altered immigrants’ characteristics across a number of dimensions, including demographics, source region, work experience and geographic distributions. This paper examines whether immigrants’ earnings immediately after their landing improved as a result of these changes and, if so, which characteristics contributed the most to this improvement.</p>

This research is possible because a new dataset has been created in which the immigration status of business owners can be determined. The analysis focuses on two types of businesses: private incorporated businesses and the unincorporated self-employed. Results are presented for immigrants who have entered Canada since 1980 and who were in the country in 2010, hereafter simply referred to as immigrants in Canada. In addition, two entering cohorts of immigrants are tracked to determine the business ownership trajectory during the first 5 to 10 years in Canada.</p>

Most researchers would agree that few families migrate based on the expected outcomes for one individual alone. However, the literature is silent on how these collective migration strategies are negotiated and determined. In particular little is known about how the experiences of spouses and children contribute to the settlement and integration process once migrant families arrive and attempt to settle in Canada; coping mechanisms, family strategies, and the attainment of family well-being are seriously under researched. The information that does exist tends to be anecdotal.</p>

These objectives often generate conflicting conclusions regarding immigration policy direction. To complicate matters, concerns regarding short run objectives may or may not line up with longer run goals. And finally, conclusions regarding immigration policy depend upon whose perspective the goals reflect, those of the immigrant themselves, Canadian workers, Canadian employers, or Canadian society as a whole</p>

The recent diversification of migratory flows has, however, had profound impacts on the forms of political regulation. This is notably the case for official language minority communities (OLMC). For several years, the declining number of Canadians whose maternal language is French has prompted immigration to be seen as a way to compensate for the decline of Francophones outside of Quebec and to contribute to the vitality and survival of these communities. Specific plans to attract and retain Francophone immigrants were implemented during the 2000s, and as a result, a large portion of Francophone minority communities are immigrants, creating new plurilingual and multicultural Francophone spaces.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/reports-statistics/research/low-income-immigration-overview-future-directions-research.html"><strong>Low-income and Immigration: An Overview and Future Directions for Research</strong></a><p>Recent trends indicate that the gap between the low-income rates for immigrants and those born in Canada has increased substantially since 1980. Rising low-income rates among more recent immigrants relative to both the Canadian-born and immigrants who have been in Canada longer are cause for concern because low-income potentially impacts the ability of immigrant individuals and families to participate economically, socially, culturally, and with dignity in their communities. While the latest research results point to improvements in immigrant economic outcomes relative to the Canadian-born, there remain immigrants who have not seen an increase in relative economic performance, and who live in chronic low-income. This is potentially one of the most serious social and labour market challenges that Canada is facing. The objective of this report is to provide an overview of the low-income situation of immigrants in Canada with the goal of highlighting aspects of this issue in need of additional research. This report is organized into four parts. Part one considers the policy importance of the issue of low-income and immigration. Part two provides a description of low-income measures and touches upon differences to reflect on when using these indicators to evaluate immigrant economic outcomes. This is followed in part three by an examination, based on a review of the research literature, of the factors that contribute to the low-income situations of immigrants in Canada. Finally, part four provides a brief summary, along with research and data considerations for the investigation of low-income and immigration going forward.</p>

Canada’s immigration program does this by attracting new immigrants, helping them integrate into the labour market and ensuring that success is attainable for all newcomers. Current demographic trends indicate that these newcomers will play an increasingly important part in the labour market. This is underscored by the twin demographic challenges on the horizon: the first being the retirement of a large number of baby boomers and second, a limited number of new workers who are coming from domestic sources. The central questions addressed in this paper, then, are how will the Canadian labour market evolve over the coming decade and what will be the role of the immigration program in this challenging environment?</p>

There has been some intermittent and partial exploration of these attitudes in various individual commercial and in some academic work, but no systematic review of the public literature on the state of opinion on these issues. The primary purpose of this project is to identify and analyze existing public opinion data on the Canadian public’s attitudes towards multiculturalism and immigration, and review literature that analyzes such data.</p>

Examining the determinants of labour market outcomes for recent immigrants, including social capital components, is an essential step in understanding this phenomenon. In light of the difficulties of recent immigrants to assimilate into the Canadian labour market, the role of social capital as a mechanism for understanding the socio-economic progress of immigrants is increasingly prompting public interest (Kunz 2005). Different definitions of social capital have been used to examine broad contexts such as educational attainment (Sun 1999; Israel and Beaulieu 2004), job search (Montgomery 1991), and health services utilization (Deri 2005).</p>

Returns to social capital in the labour market have been explored increasingly over the last decade (e.g. Lin 1999; Staiger 1990; Calvó-Armengol and Jackson 2003). Despite an important theoretical literature arguing that using contacts or networks increases wages and occupational status (e.g. Granovetter 1995; Lin 2001), the empirical results on the effects of social capital on labour market outcomes vary with the contexts of the studies. The disparity of measurements of social capital and the unavailability of relevant data leave the empirical question open.</p>
