 <li>"Program Integrity and Quality Assurance" is about delivering the right service, to the right person, for the right reasons, in a consistent manner. Operationally, this includes undertaking activities that maintain the integrity of the program and sound risk management practices, by giving attention to every stage of the delivery process.

        <h2>7. Provincial Designation and Endorsement Processes</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>7.1. Newfoundland and Labrador has the sole and non-transferable responsibility to:</p>  <p>7.1.1. designate employers with genuine labour market needs who are eligible to identify applicants who meet those needs and who may apply to the program; and, </p>  <p>7.1.2. endorse a prospective applicant for application to the program, based on the genuineness of the job offer, verification of the individual’s pre-endorsement needs assessment and settlement plan and a commitment from the employer to assist, and where necessary provide settlement services to meet identified needs.</p>  <p>7.2. Newfoundland and Labrador agrees to accept only those applications for designation or endorsement submitted on the official designation and endorsement applications available on the Provincial website. Further, Newfoundland and Labrador agrees not make changes to the content of these forms without prior consultation and agreement from Canada and the other Atlantic provinces.</p>  <p>7.3. In order to exercise its responsibility to designate employers under this Agreement, Newfoundland and Labrador will require the employer make an application to the province. Newfoundland and Labrador agrees that it will, at minimum, assess the application to determine that:</p>  <p>7.3.1. the employer is not in violation of the IRPA or IRPR as indicated by information provided by Canada in response to a request from Newfoundland and Labrador pursuant to the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Memorandum of Understanding on Information Sharing; </p>  <p>7.3.2. the employer is in good standing with employment standards and occupational health and safety legislation, and the business is genuine and has been in continuous, active operation for two years in the Atlantic region, or, the employer can demonstrate continuous, active operation in another location and provide confirmation of approval from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation signaling endorsement of corporate plans to relocate within Newfoundland and Labrador; </p>  <p>7.3.3. the employer has provided or agrees to provide workplace cultural sensitivity and awareness training to the organization, including managers and staff, where a federally or provincially funded immigrant settlement service provider organization has deemed it appropriate or necessary;</p>  <p>7.3.4. the employer agrees to support retention by facilitating access to settlement supports for successful Pilot applicants and their families, including, if required, costs associated with the provision of settlement services identified in the principal applicant’s pre-endorsement needs assessment and settlement plan where these services are not provided by the province or the federal government within a timely fashion;</p>  <p>7.3.5. for the purposes of settlement supports and services, the employer agrees to recognize the preferred official language of successful Pilot applicants and their families, and to facilitate links with tailored francophone settlement supports and francophone communities, where available; and,</p>  <p>7.3.6. the employer agrees to report to the Province on the number of foreign nationals recruited under the Pilot, their employment status and details of their position/wage/hours for three (3) years from the commencement of their employment, or the duration of their employment, whichever is less.</p>  <p>7.4. Newfoundland and Labrador will issue a dated designation signaling an employer’s eligibility to participate in the Pilot. Designations will be valid for the period of the Pilot, however, Newfoundland and Labrador will conduct an annual review of existing designations to determine if the original designation remains valid and to determine if the employer continues to be in good standing with:</p>  <p>7.4.1. the IRPA/IRPR;</p>  <p>7.4.2. provincial legislation related to employment standards or occupational health and safety; and,</p>  <p>7.4.3. federal legislation related to employment standards or occupational health and safety.</p>  <p>7.5. Employer designation will be revoked, in accordance with the compliance policy appended at Schedule A:</p>  <p> 7.5.1. where the Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism becomes aware that the employer is in violation of the IRPA or the IRPR as indicated by information provided by Canada in response to a request by Newfoundland and Labrador pursuant to the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Memorandum of Understanding on Information Sharing; for any reason outlined under the compliance policy, as appended in Schedule A, and enforced by Newfoundland and Labrador; or, </p>  <p>7.5.2. where the Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism becomes aware of fraud or misrepresentation in the application for designation or endorsement or the application of the foreign national for permanent residence as it relates to the job offer.</p>  <p>7.6. Employer designation may be revoked, at the discretion of Newfoundland and Labrador, in accordance with the Compliance Policy appended at Schedule A, where the Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism becomes aware of employer non-compliance with provincial and/or federal legislation related to employment standards or occupational health and safety that occur after initial designation.</p>  <p>7.7. Where Newfoundland and Labrador has revoked an employer designation, Newfoundland and Labrador will inform Canada immediately, in writing to a location specified by Canada. An update of the record of endorsement will be made to affected files, noting the de-designation. Newfoundland and Labrador will provide the updated records of endorsement to Canada immediately upon de-designation of the employer supporting the endorsement.</p>  <p>7.8. Newfoundland and Labrador will be responsible for making all reasonable efforts to notify all affected applicants of the impacts of the de-designation and of the avenues of recourse available. </p>  <p>7.9. Where a designation has been revoked, Newfoundland and Labrador will enforce the Compliance Policy referenced in Schedule A.</p>  <p>7.10. In exercising its responsibility to designate an employer and endorse prospective applicants under this Agreement, Newfoundland and Labrador will apply the processes established under the Pilot, as referenced in sections 7.1 through 7.9 and as amended from time to time by agreement of the Parties, insofar as these criteria, policy and procedures are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR or any successor legislation and regulations, national immigration policies and the terms of this Agreement. This process will be applied to all employers designated and applicants endorsed under the Pilot, and Newfoundland and Labrador does not have the authority to waive any part of these processes.</p>  <p>7.11. In exercising its responsibility to endorse a prospective applicant for immigration Newfoundland and Labrador, will require the employer to complete an application for endorsement for each applicant to the Pilot. The application for endorsement must be accompanied by all agreed upon documentation as per the endorsement application. The application for endorsement will, at minimum, determine that the: </p>  <p>7.11.1. job offer is genuine, full-time and based on the labour market needs identified by the province; 7.11.2 employer has committed to facilitate access to a minimum level of settlement support for the applicant and family members, as identified in their pre-endorsement needs assessments and settlement plans, including up to 300 hours of language training as required to reach Canadian Language Benchmark level five for the principal applicant; </p>  <p>7.11.3. employer has engaged a provincially or federally approved immigrant settlement service provider organization to provide the necessary settlement supports and where the supports are not available, the employer commits to supporting the foreign national in obtaining appropriate services; and,</p>  <p>7.11.4. applicant understands the employer’s commitment to provide settlement services.</p>  <p>7.12. Newfoundland and Labrador is responsible for verifying that all documentation supporting the designation and endorsement processes is genuine. As part of this process, Newfoundland and Labrador will conduct due diligence in assessing all documentation required for the designation and endorsement applications to confirm that the information supports the employer’s stated intention to support settlement and the job offer is genuine.</p>  <p>7.13. Newfoundland and Labrador does not have authority to designate an employer, or endorse a prospective applicant, who does not meet the designation or endorsement criteria. Further, Newfoundland and Labrador will not issue an endorsement to an employer who intends to hire:</p>  <p>7.13.1. any person whose employment is likely to affect the settlement of any labour dispute or affect the employment of a person involved in such a dispute; or,</p>  <p>7.13.2. any person whose employment will adversely affect employment or training opportunities for Canadian citizens or permanent residents in Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>  <p>7.14. Newfoundland and Labrador agrees to consider only applications for endorsement from designated employers and supported by a comprehensive pre-endorsement needs assessment and settlement plan conducted by an approved immigrant settlement service provider organization. A list of approved service provider organizations, to be amended from time to time, is available on the Department’s website.</p>  <p>7.15. Provincial decision to endorse an applicant will be based solely on the basis of labour market demands in the province and on the criteria for endorsement as expressly provided in this Agreement, including the commitment of the employer to assist the principal applicant and his or her family member’s access to settlement services to meet their needs, as set out in the comprehensive pre-endorsement needs assessments and settlement plans. Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections, shall not constitute a determining factor in the decision to endorse.</p>  <p>7.16. Newfoundland and Labrador will issue a dated endorsement with a unique endorsement number, valid in accordance with Newfoundland and Labrador’s requirements for endorsement. For security reasons, Newfoundland and Labrador will forward a record of the endorsement, by electronic means, to Canada. The endorsement will specify the information elements as outlined in the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Memorandum of Understanding on Information sharing, including but not limited to the endorsement number, class under which the applicant will be counted, and confirmation that the employer has been designated by Newfoundland and Labrador. An endorsement received directly from the applicant or employer will not be accepted as evidence pursuant to sections 7.1 and 8.1. Should an employer be de-designated Newfoundland and Labrador will provide to Canada an updated record of endorsement for all applicants affected by the de-designation.</p>  <p>7.17. Prospective applicants must file a complete application for immigration with Canada within the time limit specified on the endorsement or within ninety (90) days of submitting an application for a temporary work permit under the Pilot, whichever is less. Newfoundland and Labrador agrees that endorsements will be valid for six (6) months from certification, unless earlier revoked by Newfoundland and Labrador in its sole discretion, and that no extensions to the endorsement will be granted. All endorsements that have not resulted in the submission of an application for permanent residence will cease to be valid as of December 31, 2019 or the end of the program, whichever is later.</p>  <p>7.18. Newfoundland and Labrador will keep written or electronic records of all designations and endorsements issued as part of the Pilot for a minimum of six (6) years from the date of approval. Newfoundland and Labrador will share those records with Canada if requested to do so.</p>

        <h2>8. Selection</h2>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>8.1. Upon receipt of the application for permanent residence, together with the endorsement from Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada will:</p>  <p>8.1.1. determine the eligibility of the prospective applicant as a member of one of the three (3) classes established under the Pilot pursuant to the Ministerial Instructions;</p>  <p>8.1.2. determine the admissibility of the prospective applicant, and his or her dependents, with respect to legislative requirements; and,</p>  <p>8.1.3. issue permanent resident visas to applicants and accompanying dependents who meet all the eligibility requirements of the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program class and the admissibility requirements of the IRPA and the IRPR. </p>  <p>8.2. Canada shall consider Newfoundland and Labrador’s endorsement as evidence that Newfoundland and Labrador has determined that hiring a foreign national under the Pilot will be of economic benefit to the Newfoundland and Labrador. Notwithstanding, Canada has authority to make the final selection decision. </p>  <p>8.3. In all cases where Canada determines that an applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements of the specific Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program class to which they have applied, or fails to meet admissibility requirements under the IRPA, Canada has authority to, and will, refuse the application. Canada will notify Newfoundland and Labrador of the decision, and reason(s) for which the application was refused, once the final decision has been made. On a monthly basis, Canada will provide reports on the processing and permanent resident admissions of applicants destined to Newfoundland and Labrador through the Pilot, including the elements as outlined in the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Memorandum of Understanding on Information Sharing.</p>  <p>8.4.

         <p>9.1. Canada may issue a work permit for applicants recruited by employers designated by Newfoundland and Labrador, pursuant to the IRPR, provided that the Department has received, from the applicant</p>  <p>9.1.1. a job offer, consistent with the requirements of the Minister Instructions classes, from a designated employer; </p>  <p>9.1.2. a letter from the Province; and, </p>  <p>9.1.3. a commitment by the applicant to submit an eligible permanent residence application within ninety (90) days from the date of submission of their application for a labour market impact assessment-exempt work permit.</p>  <p>9.2. The letter from Newfoundland and Labrador, referred to in 9.1.2, must:</p>  <p>9.2.1. request Canada to issue a work permit;</p>  <p>9.2.2. state that the applicant is urgently required by the employer; and,</p>  <p>9.2.3. confirm that the Province has received and reviewed for completion the following documents:</p>  <ol class="lst-lwr-alph"> 
 <li>a job offer consistent with the requirements of the Ministerial Instructions classes, from a designated employer that is not seasonal or part time, and is sufficient to attract and retain Canadian citizens or permanent residents. The wages offered must fall within the range of wages for that particular occupation within the specified region, as identified by the federal government;</li> 
 <li>an endorsement application which includes a pre-endorsement needs assessment and settlement plan for the applicant and his family, signed by both the designated employer and the applicant; and,</li> 
 <li>a commitment by the applicant to submit an eligible permanent residence application within ninety (90) days from the submission of the application for a temporary work permit. </li> 
</ol>  <p>9.3. Notwithstanding section 9.1 and 9.2, the applicant must meet all other IRPA/IRPR requirements, including admissibility, required for the issuance of a work permit.</p>  <p>9.4. Canada will monitor the temporary work permit pathway, and has authority to cancel, or modify, the temporary pathway option where program integrity issues arise, in consultation with all Atlantic Provinces. </p>  <p>9.5. In the event that the designation of an employer of a temporary work permit holder is revoked, Newfoundland and Labrador agrees to assist the temporary work permit holder to find new employment commensurate with the applicant’s skills and training and the existing temporary work. Where Newfoundland and Labrador is unable to find an employer able to take on the duties and responsibilities associated with employment of a Pilot applicant, where that individual would have applied for the Intermediate Skilled (NOC C) class, Newfoundland and Labrador will inform the employer of the employer’s responsibility for costs associated with the worker’s return to their country of origin, monitor and report on employer’s compliance with this requirement.</p>  <p>9.6. The Province agrees to monitor the number of letters issued to applicants referred to in 9.1.2, to ensure that it does not exceed the number of applications allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador under the Pilot.</p>  <p>9.7. Newfoundland and Labrador will issue each letter with a unique identifier, valid in accordance with section 9.2. For security reasons, the Province will forward a record of that letter, by electronic means, to Canada. The letter will specify the information elements outlined in the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Memorandum of Understanding on Information Sharing. A letter received from the client or employer for which Canada has not received a record will not be accepted as evidence pursuant to section 9.2.</p>

 <li>ensuring they meet all of the conditions and requirements of the Pilot as outlined in the employer designation and endorsement forms (including the needs assessment and settlement plan);</li> 
 <li>keeping all records associated to their Pilot designation, endorsement and any documents that demonstrate their compliance with the program conditions for six (6) years; </li>

        <h3>Employer Non-Compliance: </h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p> In order to be designated, employers must currently be in good standing with provincial occupational health and safety and labour authorities and not be in violation of the Immigration, Refugee and Protection Act (IRPA) or Immigration, Refugee and Protection Regulations (IRPR), as indicated by information provided by Canada pursuant to the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Memorandum of Understanding on Information Sharing. </p>  <p> Employer non-compliance with the IRPA or IRPR triggers a clear protocol to revoke the employer’s designation statusDesignation is initially granted for the duration of the AIPP (i.e., three (3) years), with an annual review to confirm that information provided in the original designation remains valid. </p>  <p> An employer will have their designation revoked where: </p>  <ul> 
 <li>Designated employer has violated the IRPA/IRPR and a warning, order, and/or administrative monetary penalty is issued, as indicated by information provided by Canada pursuant to the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Memorandum of Understanding Information Sharing. </li> 
</ul>  <p> An employer may have their designation revoked where: </p>  <ul> 
 <li>The Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism becomes aware that the designated employer has been found non-compliant with provincial legislation related to employment standards or occupational health and safety, or federal legislation related to employment standards or occupational health and safety where Newfoundland and Labrador becomes aware of the non-compliance.</li> 
</ul>  <p> Where a province has refused to designate or has de-designated an employer under the Pilot due to a violation of existing legislation, and the business is subsequently sold with ownership transferring to a new operator, the decision to refuse or rescind designation is not removed. The decision transfers with the sale to the new operator and remains valid in the company’s name for the duration of the Pilot. </p>

        <h3>Process of De-designation: </h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p> If an assessment concludes that a violation warranting revocation of the employer designation has occurred, the province will notify the employer in writing that the process of de-designation is commencing and that a sixty (60) day probationary status is in effect. The notice will include information about the term(s) or condition(s) violated, how the employer failed to comply, the evidence supporting the determination, the consequences and next steps. An employer will be required to submit a written response within thirty days of receipt of the notice regarding any discrepancies relating to the suspected violation, the proposed consequence, or both. </p>  <p> During this sixty (60) day period, the employer cannot submit an application for endorsement by the province. The province will notify IRCC immediately of the investigation and affected permanent residence applications and will follow-up with IRCC to communicate the outcome of the process. Employers that have had their designation revoked, will be unable to access the Pilot for a period of three (3) years. The Province will also make all reasonable efforts to notify, in writing, all affected foreign nationals of the decision and next steps. </p>

They are however eligible to apply with a job offer from another designated employer provided they have received a new endorsement from the province and otherwise meet the requirements of the Pilot. The province will undertake to facilitate the process of finding new employment by providing the foreign national with information regarding employment opportunities with other designated employers. </p>

In the case of a Dispute or disagreement under this Agreement, the designated representatives will attempt to resolve the matter through information sharing, communications and informal discussions. In the event that the designated representatives are unable to resolve the Dispute expeditiously, it will be referred to the Agreement Management Committee (AMC) Co-Chairs, accompanied by relevant facts and steps taken to reach resolution. Such procedures will provide equal opportunities for representation by each Party, establish clear time limits, and ensure clarity for the implementation of final decisions. Further, in the event resolution is not reached within thirty (30) days of being raised with the AMC Co-Chairs, the Parties will jointly determine next steps.</p>  <p>1.3. The Agreement Management Committee (AMC) is co-chaired by ADMs for Canada and the Province (or their designates where mutually agreed upon). Other members can include local, regional, National Headquarters IRCC officials and, as appropriate, representatives of other federal departments and provincial ministries responsible for program and services related to immigration.</p>  <p>1.4. Either Party may refer the matter to the Deputy Minister of the Department and the Deputy Minister(s) responsible for immigration in Newfoundland and Labrador by providing him/her with a written notice.</p>  <p>1.5. Both Parties will exchange all relevant information and engage in bilateral discussions in an attempt to clarify and resolve the Dispute. Deputy Ministers will:</p>  <p>1.5.1. provide equal opportunities for representation by each Party; </p>  <p>1.5.2. attempt to resolve Disputes within thirty (30) days; and, </p>  <p>1.5.3. ensure clarity for the implementation of final decisions.</p>  <p>1.6. Should the Dispute be resolved, Deputy Ministers will oversee drafting of a short report identifying the issues that have been resolved, specific actions and timelines required to implement the resolution.</p>  <p>1.7. If Deputy Ministers are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days from the date of its referral to them, they would determine the appropriate course of action for its resolution, including elevating the Dispute to Ministers.</p>  <p>1.8. Ministers will provide advice and direction to their officials on an appropriate course of action to resolve the Dispute.</p>  <p>1.8.1. This Dispute management process shall not in any way limit the final authority of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration respecting decisions to interpret and administer the IRPA or the IRPR.</p>
