<h2 id="foreign">Sponsors of Foreign Nationals (PPU 013)</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> To support family reunification, family class provisions of the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</em> (IRPA) enable Canadian citizens and permanent residents of Canada to apply to sponsor eligible family members for immigration, including spouses and partners, dependent children, parents, and grandparents.</p>

They also provide the Minister with the means to grant permanent or temporary residence to individuals based on humanitarian and compassionate consideration, and/or for public policy reasons.</p>
<p>In keeping with the above, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) collects, uses, discloses and retains information about Canadian citizens or permanent residents who apply to sponsor foreign nationals seeking permanent resident status in Canada; foreign nationals who are sponsored for permanent residence or who apply under a discretionary policy; and family members included in an application.

<h2 id="passports">Regular and Official Passports (PPU 081)</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Passport Program processes applications for regular and official passports.</p>
<p>This bank describes information related to individuals who have applied for a passport. Personal information collected by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for regular and official passports may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name (current and previous);</li>
<li>Contact information, including emergency contact information;</li>
<li>Date of birth;</li>
<li>Place of birth;</li>
<li>Sex and/or gender;</li>
<li>Biographical information;</li>
<li>Marital status, including year of marriage and name of spouse;</li>
<li>Signature;</li>
<li>Occupation history including employment and education history;</li>
<li>Occupation details including title, accreditation, and employee service number;</li>
<li>Address history for up to five year prior to the date of application;</li>
<li>Photographs;</li>
<li>Physical attributes;</li>
<li>Biometric information (including facial recognition alphanumeric photo identifier);</li>
<li>Citizenship status including certificate number and registration number;</li>
<li>Date and place of death for deceased passport bearers and deceased parents/legal guardians for children;</li>
<li>Travel information;</li>
<li>Language;</li>
<li>Other identification numbers as reflected on documents used to support an individual’s identity;</li>
<li>Supporting documentation in relation to custody of, access to, and mobility of a child, court records and power of attorney;</li>
<li>Supporting documentation in relation to changes to biographical information and medical records; and</li>
<li>Other information collected in order to determine an individual’s ongoing entitlement to a travel document.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class of individuals</strong>: The information described in this bank relates to Canadian citizens and in exceptional cases to non-Canadians who have applied for passports. The program also holds information about individuals who act as guarantors, emergency contacts, personal references, individuals who submit an application on behalf of an applicant (e.g., family members, parents, tutors or guardians), the person(s) authorized to apply for a passport for a child, representatives (e.g. power of attorney, legal representative for incapable individuals, or a third party that acts on behalf of a guarantor), and passport photo service providers.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The personal information described in this bank is used to determine an applicant’s current and ongoing entitlement to a Canadian passport and to administer passport services. Personal information is collected pursuant to the <em>Canadian Passport Order</em> (SI 81-86), as amended and the <em>Diplomatic and Special Passports Order.</em></p>
<p><strong>Consistent Uses:</strong> As authorized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) provides domestic passport service delivery functions and Global Affairs Canada (GAC) provides international passport service delivery functions, respectively.&nbsp; In support of passport program delivery, information may be disclosed between the three departments, (insert reference to ESDC Passport Program PIB once registration completed by TBS) as described in the GAC institution specific personal information bank Consular Affairs-Assistance to Canadians, GAC PPU 010.</p>
<p>Information may be disclosed to GAC in the event that a Canadian passport applicant or holder requires assistance abroad (see Consular Affairs-Assistance to Canadians, GAC PPU 010). Information may also be exchanged with GAC to determine whether grounds exist to refuse or revoke in cases where children were born in Canada to foreign diplomats/non-Canadians working for foreign governments in Canada. Children born in Canada to foreign diplomats or non-Canadians working for foreign governments in Canada do not acquire Canadian citizenship at birth and are therefore not eligible for a Canadian passport.</p>
<p>All personal information collected is subject to verification and to security queries to authenticate identity, eligibility and entitlement. In undertaking these queries, information may be disclosed to and/or collected from various government departments, including provincial and territorial identity document issuing institutions.&nbsp; Information may also be shared with other programs within IRCC to verify the identity and/or citizenship (see Application and Assessment for Canadian Citizenship, IRCC PIB PPU 050) of any person listed amongst the Class of Individuals. IRCC may also exchange information with third parties used to receive passport applications submitted in person.</p>
<p>All information collected may be used to determine whether grounds exist to refuse the issuance of a passport, to cancel or revoke a valid passport, and/or to impose a period of refusal for passport services. In exercising this right, personal information may be shared with Public Safety Canada so that the Minister of Public Safety may exercise his refusal, cancellation and revocation authorities.</p>
<p>Personal information may be shared with law enforcement and security agencies to determine if there are grounds for passport refusal, cancellation or revocation. Information about the applicant may be shared with Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) to identify offenders who are incarcerated (see Case Management, CSC PIB PPU 042). Information about the applicant may be shared with the Parole Board of Canada (PBC) to identify offenders and parolees (see Conditional Release Decisions (Parole), PBC PPU 005).&nbsp; Information about the applicant may also be shared with the Department of Justice to identify debtors who are subject to a license denial application under the <em>Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act</em> (FOAEAA) (see Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance, JUS PPU 125).</p>
<p>IRCC uses facial recognition technology to convert an applicant’s photo into a biometric template and to compare that template with information contained in the Passport facial recognition database.</p>
<p>Personal information that is printed on passports is also electronically stored on a chip embedded in the passport booklet.</p>
<p>Personal information may be disclosed to other governments (municipal, provincial, territorial, and foreign), police forces, an international organization of states, or an international organization established by the governments of states (e.g., INTERPOL) for the purpose of administering or enforcing any law or carrying out a lawful investigation.&nbsp; Information may also be shared with investigative bodies such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), and the Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) (see Disclosure to Investigative Bodies, PSU 913).</p>
<p>Information about invalidated travel documents and the individuals to whom the documents were issued is disclosed to the RCMP and is available to police services across Canada via Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). The information is also disclosed to INTERPOL (via CPIC) and available to foreign law enforcement and border control authorities via INTERPOL’s Stolen and Lost Travel Document (SLTD) database.</p>
<p>Information may also be used or disclosed for evaluation, reporting, and verification purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Retention and Disposal Standards</strong>: Passport applications and all supporting documentation are retained until an applicant has reached 100 years of age. When an individual holds a valid Canadian passport that will expire after his/her 100th birthday, the passport application and supporting documentation are retained electronically for one additional period that is equivalent to the validity period of the passport. Microfilmed passport applications and all supporting documentation will be retained for 75 years.</p>
<p>Biometric information is stored by the RCMP on behalf of IRCC and retained for 15 years from the time of the most recent biometric collection. That information is systematically destroyed after 15 years or upon granting of Canadian Citizenship. Biometric information attached to an individual who has been deemed inadmissible under sections 34 through 37 of the IRPA will be retained until the individual has reached the age of 100.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>&nbsp; Historically IRCC (formerly Passport Canada) collected the social insurance number (SIN) when the SIN was provided by an applicant in support of his or her identity. That practice ceased on August 2014 and the SIN is no longer collected by IRCC. Records of SINs collected may remain in records under the control of the department in keeping with the retention standards above.</p>
<p>IRCC may use the services of third parties to receive passport applications submitted in person. These services are limited to those of a Receiving Agent, as provided by Canada Post Corporation and the Service Canada initiative within Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) (see Receiving Agent, ESDC PPU 702).</p>

<p><strong>Class of Individuals:</strong> Individuals who have, or are suspected of having misused, committed fraud or made a false statement in obtaining, produced or used a Canadian passport, certificate of identity or refugee travel document; who is liable to commit sexual offences involving minors; who have lost possession or control of more than one passport (through loss or theft) within a the validity period of five years; whose legal right to apply on behalf of a child under 16 years of age has not been established or is questionable;&nbsp; who stand charged with the commission of an indictable offence; who are serving a term of imprisonment or otherwise forbidden by either domestic or foreign authorities to leave Canada or a foreign country; who permit another person to use the passport; who are indebted to the Crown for expenses related to repatriation to Canada or for other consular financial assistance provided abroad at their request by the Government of Canada; who are wanted by law enforcement agencies; who may present a threat to national security in Canada or that of another country; guarantor or individuals listed on an application form (e.g. references) that could be related to the applicant/bearer; individuals with discrepancies/variations in their place of birth or date of birth; individuals who are subject to license denial under the <em>Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act</em> (FOAEAA); or children and parents/guardians where there are concerns related to possible child abduction.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The personal information described in this bank is used to determine an individual’s current and ongoing entitlement to a Canadian passport or travel document and to administer passport or travel document services.</p>
<p>Personal information is collected pursuant to the <em>Canadian Passport Order</em> (SI 81-86), as amended. Some personal information is collected pursuant to sections 68 and 79(c) of the FOAEAA and is used to assist IRCC in determining if a debtor identified by the Department of Justice is the same person as the one requesting passport services or holding a passport, before taking appropriate actions in accordance with the above mentioned Act.</p>
<p><strong>Consistent Uses:</strong> Pursuant to the <em>Canadian Passport Order</em>, and as authorized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) provides domestic passport service delivery functions and Global Affairs Canada (GAC) provides international passport service delivery functions, respectively.&nbsp; In support of passport program delivery, information may be disclosed between the three departments, (insert reference to ESDC Passport Program PIB once registration completed by TBS) as described in the GAC institution specific personal information bank Consular Affairs-Assistance to Canadians, GAC PPU 010.</p>
<p>Information may be disclosed to GAC in the event that a Canadian passport applicant or holder requires assistance abroad (see Consular Affairs-Assistance to Canadians, GAC PPU 010). Information may also be exchanged with GAC to determine whether grounds exist to refuse or revoke in cases where children were born in Canada to foreign diplomats/non-Canadians working for foreign governments in Canada.&nbsp; Children born in Canada to foreign diplomats or non-Canadians working for foreign governments in Canada do not acquire Canadian citizenship at birth and are therefore not eligible for a Canadian passport.</p>
<p>All personal information collected is subject to verification and to security queries to authenticate identity, eligibility and entitlement.&nbsp; In undertaking these queries, information may be disclosed to and/or collected from various government departments, including provincial and territorial identity document issuing institutions.&nbsp; Information may also be shared with other programs within IRCC to verify the identity and/or citizenship (see Application and Assessment for Canadian Citizenship, IRCC PIB PPU 050) of any person listed amongst the Class of Individuals.

<p>IRCC uses facial recognition technology to convert an applicant’s photo into a biometric template and to compare that template with information contained in the Passport facial recognition database.</p>
<p>Personal information that is printed on passports and travel documents is also electronically stored on a chip embedded in the passport booklet and travel document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal information may be disclosed to other governments (municipal, provincial, territorial, and foreign), police forces, an international organization of states, or an international organization established by the governments of states (e.g., INTERPOL) for the purpose of administering or enforcing any law or carrying out a lawful investigation. Information may also be shared with investigative bodies such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), and the Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) (see Disclosure to Investigative Bodies, PSU 913).</p>
<p>Information about invalidated travel documents and the individuals to whom the documents were issued is disclosed to the RCMP and is available to police services across Canada via Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). The information is also disclosed to INTERPOL (via CPIC) and available to foreign law enforcement and border control authorities via INTERPOL’s Stolen and Lost Travel Document (SLTD) database.</p>
