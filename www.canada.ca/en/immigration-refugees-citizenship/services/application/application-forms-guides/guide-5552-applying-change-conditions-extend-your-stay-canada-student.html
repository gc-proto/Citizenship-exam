It is your responsibility to ensure your TRV remains valid if you wish to <strong>leave and re-enter Canada</strong>. If you currently reside in Canada and would like to obtain a new TRV, you must apply to the <a href="../../../corporate/contact-ircc/offices/case-processing-centre-ottawa-ontario.html">Case Processing Centre – Ottawa</a> before leaving. If you decide to leave, you must apply for and obtain a TRV abroad by applying to a Canadian visa office (see <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/visa.asp"><em>Application for a Temporary Resident Visa</em></a>).</li>
<li><strong>For applicants who require an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to enter Canada</strong>: As of May 1, 2017, an eTA is automatically issued to you with the renewal of your study permit. However, if you plan to leave and return to Canada by air before renewing your permit, you must apply for an eTA separately.</li>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your application is rejected as “incomplete”, it is considered to have never been submitted and therefore you would not benefit from ‘<a href="../../../corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/implied-status-extending-stay.html">implied status’</a>.
