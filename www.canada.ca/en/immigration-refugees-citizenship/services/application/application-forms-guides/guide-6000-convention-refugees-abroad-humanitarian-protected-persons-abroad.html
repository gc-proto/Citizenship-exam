<li><a href="#information">Other information</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step1">Step 1: Make sure you are eligible to come to Canada as a refugee</h2>
<p>To be eligible you, the Principal Applicant (PA), and your family members must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>be referred by a:<ul>
<li>refugee referral organization such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); or</li>
<li>a private sponsor;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>meet the definition of Convention Refugee Abroad Class or Country of Asylum Class (Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad);</li>
<li>show that you have no durable solution; and</li>
<li>pass medical, security and criminality checks.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Be referred by a refugee referral organization or by private sponsors</h3>
<p>If you do not have a private sponsor or have not been referred by a designated referral organization, at this point, you are <strong>not</strong> eligible for resettlement as a refugee to Canada and this guide does <strong>not</strong> apply to you.</p>
<p>If you have a private sponsor in Canada, they should have contacted you to complete the forms included in this guide.</p>
<p>If you have been referred by a designated referral organization, the IRCC office overseas should have contacted you to complete the forms included in this guide.</p>
<h3>2. Meet the definition of Convention Refugee Abroad Class or Country of Asylum Class (Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad)</h3>
<h4>Convention Refugees Abroad Class</h4>
<p>The word “Convention” refers to the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">
<li>You are a Convention Refugee Abroad if you:<ul class="mrgn-tp-sm">
<li>are afraid of persecution because of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; and<ul>
<li>are outside Canada;</li>
<li>are outside your country of nationality and unable or, because of your fear, unwilling to obtain the protection of your country; or</li>
<li>if you have no country of nationality, are outside your country of former habitual residence (home country) and unable or, because of your fear, unwilling to return to that country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Country of Asylum Class (Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad)</h4>
<p>The Country of Asylum Class is Canada’s response to the resettlement needs of people in refugee-like situations who do not qualify as Convention Refugees.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">
<li>You are a member of the Country of Asylum Class if you:<ul class="mrgn-tp-sm">
<li>are seriously and personally affected by civil or armed conflict or a massive violation of human rights in your country of nationality or habitual residence (home country); and<ul>
<li>are outside Canada;</li>
<li>are outside your country of nationality and unable or, because of your fear, unwilling to obtain the protection of your country; or</li>
<li>if you have no country of nationality, are outside your country of former habitual residence (home country) and unable or, because of your fear, unwilling to return to that country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Show that you have no durable solution</h3>
<h4>Durable solutions</h4>
<p>When considering an application for resettlement in Canada, a Migration Officer must be satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect, within a reasonable period of time, for the refugee applicant to obtain another durable solution.</p>
<p>There are three types of durable solutions:</p>
<h5>Voluntary repatriation</h5>
<p>Voluntary repatriation occurs when refugees voluntarily return to their country of nationality or habitual residence. For voluntary repatriation to be possible, the situation in the country of origin must have changed in a lasting and meaningful way that enables the refugees to return safely.</p>
<h5>Local integration</h5>
<p>Local integration is a long-lasting solution to a refugee’s situation. It is more than the granting of safe conditions of asylum. Local integration allows refugees to participate broadly in the host society.</p>
<h5>Resettlement in a country other than Canada</h5>
<p>An offer of resettlement to a country (other than Canada).</p>
<h3>4. Pass medical, security and criminality checks</h3>
<p>You and your family members included in your application must do a medical exam by a doctor chosen by the IRCC office overseas. IRCC will also perform background and security checks for all applicants who wish to immigrate to Canada. This includes checks into any past criminal behaviour, violations, infractions, etc. We will not contact organizations or individuals if it puts you or your family in danger.</p>
<h3>Common questions about eligible family members</h3>
<h4>Who is the principal applicant?</h4>
<p>If there is only one person applying for permanent residence, that person is by default the principal applicant. When a family applies for permanent residence together, one family member must be the principal applicant. The principal applicant is usually the head of family.</p>
<h4>Who can be included as family members?</h4>
<p>Under the Canadian immigration system, a family includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the principal applicant (PA);</li>
<li>the PA’s spouse or common-law partner;</li>
<li>the PA’s dependent child;</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s dependent child;</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s spouse/common-law partner; and</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s spouse/common-law partner’s dependent child.</li>
</ul>
<p>See subsection 1(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/FullText.html">IRPR</a>) for the legal definition of the word “<strong>family member</strong>”.</p>
<p><img alt="Important information" src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/exclamation_sm.gif" class="pull-left mrgn-rght-sm"><strong>All</strong> family members <strong>must</strong> be declared in the application, even if they are not accompanying the PA to Canada.</p>
<h4>What is the difference between an accompanying family member and a non-accompanying member?</h4>
<p><strong>Accompanying family member:</strong> A family member who plans to come to Canada at the same time as the PA.</p>
<p><strong>Non-accompanying family member:</strong> A family member who has been separated from the family and is not able to, or choose not to, accompany the PA to Canada when the application was processed.</p>
<h4>Why do I need to list non-accompanying family members?</h4>
<p>Failing to declare a family member may result in the refusal of your application. Declaring family members is also important for family reunification. Under the One Year Window (OYW) provision, the PA can apply to bring their non-accompanying family members to Canada for up to one year after their arrival in Canada, but <strong>only</strong> if they were declared on the application <strong>before</strong> the PA left for Canada.</p>
<p>For more information about OYW provision, see the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5578-request-process-following-family-members-year-window-opportunity-provisions.html">OYW Application Guide (IMM 5578)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="family">Family members</h3>
<p>Your family members include your spouse or common-law partner, your dependent children and any children that are their dependent children.</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt id="spouse"><strong>Spouse</strong></dt> <dd><p>Refers to either of the two persons (opposite or same sex) in a marriage legally recognized in the country in which it took place, as well as in Canada.</p>

</dd> <dt id="commonlaw"><strong>Common-law partner</strong></dt> <dd><p>Refers to a person who is living in a conjugal relationship with another person (opposite or same sex), and has done so continuously for a period of at least one year. A conjugal relationship exists when there is a significant degree of commitment between two people.</p>
<p>This can be shown with evidence that the couple share the same home, support each other financially and emotionally, have children together, or present themselves in public as a couple.</p>
<p>Common-law partners who have been in a conjugal relationship for at least one year but are unable to live together or appear in public together because of legal restrictions in their home country or who have been separated for reasons beyond their control (for example, civil war or armed conflict) may still qualify and should be included on the application.</p>
</dd> <dt id="child"><strong>Dependent children</strong></dt> <dd><p>We assess your child’s eligibility as a dependant based on how old they were at a specific point in time, called the lock-in date; this is normally the date on which your application was received by IRCC. To see if your child qualifies as a dependant, we consider the age of your child on the lock-in date, even though your child’s age may change during processing.</p>
<p>Your child or the child of your spouse or common-law partner can be considered a dependent child if that child meets the requirements below on the lock-in date:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re <strong>under 22 years old</strong>, and</li>
<li>They don’t have a spouse or common-law partner</li>
</ul>
<p>Children 22 years old or older qualify as dependants if they meet <strong>both</strong> of these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have depended on their parents for financial support since before the age of 22, and</li>
<li>They are unable to financially support themselves because of a mental or physical condition</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of age, dependants must continue to meet these requirements until we finish processing your application.</p>
<p><strong>Not sure if your child is a dependant?</strong> <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/sponsor/aod-tool.asp">Check if your child qualifies by answering a few questions</a>.</p>
</dd> <dt id="child-child"><strong>Dependent child of a dependent child</strong></dt> <dd><p>Refers to children of dependent children of the applicant and those of the spouse or common-law partner, if applicable.</p>
</dd></dl>
<h4 id="other">What does other family members mean?</h4>
<p>You cannot include other relative in your application other than those who meet the definition of family member.</p>
<p>If you want to come to Canada with other family members (over age children, siblings, parents, cousins, etc.), these persons require a separate application. They must apply on their own, they must be refugees in their own right and they must meet all statutory requirements.</p>
<p>If other family members are being sponsored, ask your sponsors to list both the PA and the other family members in each other’s <strong>Linked/Multiple Sponsorship Undertakings</strong> on the Sponsorship Undertaking form. If we know about these linked applications, we will do our best to try and process them at the same time.</p>

        <h2 id="step4">Step 4: Submit the Application</h2>
<p><strong>Privately Sponsored Refugees (PSR):</strong> Generally, your sponsor will submit your application on your behalf to the Resettlement Operations Centre in Ottawa (ROC-O) of IRCC.</p>
<p><strong>Government Assisted Refugees (GAR):</strong> After your case is referred by the UNHCR or another referral organization, the IRCC office overseas will tell you how to submit your completed forms directly to their office.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="next">What Happens Next?</h2>
<h3>Phase 1 - PSR: Assessment of Sponsor</h3>
<p>ROC-O will assess your sponsoring group’s application to make sure it is complete and to ensure your sponsors meet the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). If the application is complete, a case file number (beginning with the letter “G”) will be assigned to your application.</p>
<p>If the sponsorship is approved, you and your sponsors will be advised and your application will be forwarded to the IRCC office overseas responsible for your country of residence. To find out which IRCC office processes applications from your country of residence, see <a href="../../../corporate/contact-ircc/offices/international-visa-offices.html">Visa offices outside Canada</a>.</p>
<p>If the sponsorship is refused, the entire application will be refused, you and your sponsors will be advised and we will not process your application further. Your application will not be returned to you.</p>
<h3>Phase 1 - GAR: Assessment of Referral and request for forms</h3>
<p>After your case is referred by a designated referral organization, the IRCC office overseas will tell you how to submit your completed forms directly to their office.</p>
<p>When your forms are received at the IRCC office overseas, you will be emailed a letter of confirmation. This letter will confirm that your application has been received and will have your assigned file number (beginning with the letter “G”). If you have not included an e-mail address you may not receive this letter.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: Eligibility Assessment</h3>
<p>You are <strong>eligible</strong> when it is determined that you meet:</p>
<ul>
<li>the convention refugee definition; or</li>
<li>country of asylum class definition</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications are assessed on a case by case basis. Once your application is ready to be assessed, a Migration Officer will review your application to determine if you are eligible.</p>
<p>In addition, we may assess your ability to resettle successfully in Canada. We will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have relatives or a sponsor in the community where you plan to live in Canada</li>
<li>your ability to speak or learn to speak English and/or Frenchv</li>
<li>your potential for employment based on your education, skills and work experience and</li>
<li>your resourcefulness and other similar characteristics that will help you adapt to life in Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage, a Migration Officer may determine that enough information is available to make a decision or, they may ask for you and all accompanying family members to come for an interview. If you are selected for an interview, we will contact you with the date, time and location and will tell you which documents to bring. You and your accompanying family members must provide biometrics (fingerprint and a live photograph) at interview.</p>
<h3>Phase 3: Admissibility Assessment</h3>
<p>You are <strong>admissible to be resettled to Canada</strong> when you pass:</p>
<ul>
<li>medical exam;</li>
<li>security checks; and</li>
<li>criminality checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are found eligible, you, your spouse, and each of your dependent children must have a medical exam by a doctor chosen by the IRCC office overseas. The doctor will tell you which tests are required. <strong>We will provide you with the instructions when the time comes. You must not complete a medical exam until we tell you to</strong>. You should not pay for your medical exam. The payment of the medical exam is paid for by the Government of Canada. If a doctor asks for you to pay money, please report this to the IRCC office overseas. Reporting such an incident will not affect processing of your application and will help ensure the integrity of the resettlement program.</p>
<p>Before we issue a visa, we do background and security checks for all applicants who wish to immigrate to Canada. This includes checks into any past criminal behaviour, violations, infractions, etc. We will not contact organizations or individuals if it puts you or your family in danger. All applicants are required to disclose any criminal past, including charges, on their IMM 0008 and Schedule A (IMM 5669) forms. If you do not disclose this information, regardless of how serious the charge, infraction or conviction is, your application may be refused.</p>
<h3>Phase 4: Final stage</h3>
<p>Once you have satisfied the Migration Officer that you are eligible and are not inadmissible, your file can be finalized. If you are privately sponsored, you will be destined to the city and province where your sponsor resides. If you are sponsored by the government, IRCC will determine the province and city where you will be resettled. The IRCC office, in cooperation with partners (IOM, UNHCR, etc.) will then arrange for your transportation and advise your sponsor and settlement services of your arrival. You will be contacted with your travel arrangements once completed. Depending on your country of nationality and residence, we may ask you to submit your passport or provide you with a travel document. Some countries require that exit permits be obtained prior to departure. Costs, processing times and procedures for exit permits vary greatly. The IRCC office overseas will provide you with more information at this stage.</p>
<h4>Things that delay processing</h4>
<p>The following <strong>may delay</strong> processing:</p>
<ul>
<li>missing or out of date contact information (phone number, e-mail address)</li>
<li>you failing to inform us of changes in family composition in a timely manner</li>
<li>delay by your sponsorship group in adding a new family member to your undertaking</li>
<li>your application is incomplete or there are gaps or missing information in your application</li>
<li>there is a criminal, security or medical problem which is identified during the examination</li>
<li>obtaining exit permits</li>
<li>you send e-mails/letters without mentioning your file number</li>
<li>you submit unclear photocopies of documents</li>
<li>you send documents without a certified English or French translation</li>
<li>we need to consult with other offices in Canada and overseas</li>
<li>you do not provide photos that meet specifications</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase 5: Arrival in Canada</h3>
<p>If you are approved to be resettled in Canada, help is available to make your adjustment to life in Canada easier as a newcomer.</p>
<p>After you arrive, you will receive a general orientation to life in Canada that will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic life skills</li>
<li>language training</li>
<li>housing</li>
<li>learning about the Canadian transportation system</li>
<li>educational services</li>
<li>grocery shopping</li>
<li>banking</li>
<li>how to start your search for employment</li>
<li>other parts of everyday life</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information">Other Information</h2>
<h3>1. Fees/loans and travel documents</h3>
<h4>Fees</h4>
<p>There are <strong>no</strong> fees for refugee applications. Sponsors are not allowed to ask you to pay for your own resettlement to Canada or for you to transfer money to Canada for your sponsorship. Sponsorship Agreement Holders are permitted to request for you to reimburse them for up to $250 per application for reasonable processing fees. If you have concerns that a group is asking you to pay money to be sponsored, please contact an IRCC office and they will be able to provide you with information on whether or not this is allowed.</p>
<h4>Immigrant loans</h4>
<p>You may be eligible for financial assistance to cover costs associated with your resettlement to Canada. If you need a loan, ask an IRCC officer for more information.</p>
<h3 id="contact">2. Updating your contact information</h3>
<ul>
<li>During the application process, you must advise IRCC of any change in your or your family member’s contact information (address phone number, <strong>new e-mail address</strong>, etc.). We must have up to date contact information for you in order to contact you when required. You can do this by completing the <a href="https://secure.cic.gc.ca/enquiries-renseignements/canada-case-cas-eng.aspx?_ga=2.210574421.1714530401.1502715343-672572301.1478610751">Case Specific Inquiry tool</a>.</li>
</ul>
