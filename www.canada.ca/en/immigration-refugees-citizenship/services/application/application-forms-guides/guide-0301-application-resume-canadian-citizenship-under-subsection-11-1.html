         <p>If you are applying for resumption of citizenship under subsection 11(1), before completing the application to resume Canadian citizenship, calculate your physical presence time to determine whether you qualify to apply now. You must be a permanent resident residing in Canada for at least 365 days during the two (2) years immediately before the date you sign your application. Time spent on probation, on parole, or in prison during this year may not qualify as physical presence time. If you have questions about your physical presence, contact the <a href="../../../corporate/contact-ircc.html">Call Centre</a>.</p>  <p>Follow the instructions carefully. <strong> An application will not be accepted for processing if all of the necessary documents have not been submitted.</strong> If you need more space to answer any questions use an extra sheet of paper and indicate the number and/or letter of the question you are answering.</p>  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The information you provide on your application and supporting documents may be subject to verification. Throughout the application process, if you or someone on your behalf provides any misleading or fraudulent information, or withhold any information that could cause an error in the administration of the <em>Citizenship Act</em>, you could be charged with an offence under the <em>Citizenship Act</em>, your application to resume citizenship could be refused, and you could be prohibited from reapplying for citizenship for five (5) years.</p>

The CRA’s legal authority to disclose income tax information including filing history upon applicant consent is provided for in paragraph 241(5)(<em>b</em>) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>. Income tax information including filing history provided by the CRA to CIC may be used to verify a citizenship applicant’s income tax information including filing history for the purpose of assessing their citizenship application against the tax filing and physical presence requirements of paragraph 11(1)(d) of the <em>Citizenship Act</em>. CIC may, on occasion, send information pertaining to a citizenship application to the CRA in respect of any relevant information related to any discrepancies between the information obtained from the applicant and that provided by the CRA if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the discrepancy is a result of false representation, fraud or concealment of material circumstances made in the course of an application, as well as any personal information, including the SIN, of an applicant that the CRA is authorized to collect for the purpose of the administration of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>.
