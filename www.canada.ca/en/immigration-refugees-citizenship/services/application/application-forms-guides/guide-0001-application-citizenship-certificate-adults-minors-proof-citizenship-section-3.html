<h3>What documents do I need?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If this application is for your <strong>first</strong> citizenship certificate
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Then</strong> provide clear and legible <strong>certified</strong> copies of your documents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If this application is for a <strong>replacement</strong> of your citizenship certificate
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Then</strong> provide clear and legible <strong>photocopies</strong> of your documents, unless otherwise stated</li>
    </ul>

<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/exclamation_sm.gif" alt=""><strong>Important information:</strong> It is contrary to the Citizenship Regulations to have more than one valid citizenship or naturalization certificate. <strong>Failure to return any certificate or any pink transmission copy of a certificate will result in delays in processing your application</strong>.

<h3>Amendments to the Citizenship Act limit citizenship by descent</h3>
<p>On April 17, 2009, the rules for Canadian citizenship changed for persons born outside Canada to Canadian parents, and who were not themselves already Canadian citizens when the rules changed.</p>
<p>Canadian citizenship by birth outside Canada to a Canadian citizen parent (citizenship by descent) is now limited to the first generation born outside Canada.</p>
<p>This means that, in general, persons who were not already Canadian citizens immediately before April&nbsp;17, 2009 and who were born outside Canada to a Canadian parent are <strong>not</strong> Canadian if:</p>
<ul>
<li>their Canadian parent was also born outside Canada to a Canadian parent (the person is therefore the second or subsequent generation born outside Canada), or</li>
<li>their Canadian parent was granted Canadian citizenship under section 5.1, the adoption provisions of the Citizenship Act (the person is therefore the second generation born outside Canada)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Exception to the first generation limit in 2009</h4>
<p>The first generation limit on claims of citizenship by descent through a parent did not apply to a person born outside Canada in the second or subsequent generation if:</p>
<ul>
<li>at the time of the person’s birth, their <strong>parent</strong> was employed outside Canada in or with the Canadian Armed Forces, the federal public administration or the public service of a province or territory, other than as a locally engaged person (a crown servant);</li>
</ul>
<p>Persons born to a Canadian parent who are not eligible for citizenship by descent due to the first generation limit may apply for and obtain permanent resident status and subsequently submit an application for a grant of citizenship under section 5 of the Citizenship Act.</p>
<p>Persons born to a Canadian parent on or after April 17, 2009 who are not eligible for citizenship by descent due to the first generation limit may be stateless Those persons may apply for a grant of citizenship under subsection 5(5) of the Citizenship Act. For further information, consult the page on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/grant/statelessness.html">Citizenship grants:&nbsp;Statelessness</a>.</p>
<p>Note: Some naturalized Canadian citizens who had a Canadian parent became Canadian citizens by descent by operation of law under these amendments and this could impact their eligibility to pass on Canadian citizenship to children born outside Canada to them or adopted by them.</p>
<h4>Amendments to the Citizenship Act extending citizenship</h4>
<p>On June 11, 2015, citizenship was extended to more persons who were born before the Canadian Citizenship Act took effect on January&nbsp;1, 1947, as well as to their children who were born outside Canada in the first generation. Specifically, the amendments gave Canadian citizenship to persons who were born or naturalized in Canada as well as to those who were British subjects ordinarily resident in Canada on January&nbsp;1, 1947 (April&nbsp;1, 1949, in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador), but who were not eligible for Canadian citizenship when the Canadian Citizenship Act took effect. The amendments also retroactively gave Canadian citizenship to the children of these persons ,as well as to children of parents who became citizens on January&nbsp;1, 1947 (or April&nbsp;1, 1949), but who did not themselves become Canadian citizens on those dates.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2014, the exception to the first generation limit to citizenship by descent was extended to children born outside Canada whose grandparent, at the time of the child’s parent’s birth or adoption, was employed outside Canada in or with the Canadian Armed Forces, the federal public administration or the public service of a province or territory, other than as a locally engaged person.</p>
<h4>Extension to the exceptions to the first generation limit in 2014</h4>
<p>The first generation limit to on claims of citizenship by descent through a parent does not apply to a person born outside Canada in the second or subsequent generation if the person is born to a Crown servant or if:</p>
<ul>
<li>at the time of their parent’s birth or adoption, the person’s <strong>grandparent</strong> was employed outside Canada in or with the Canadian Armed Forces, the federal public administration or public service of a province or territory, other than as a locally engaged person (a crown servant).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Some naturalized Canadian citizens who had a Canadian parent became Canadian citizens by descent by operation of law under these amendments, which and this could impact their eligibility to pass on Canadian citizenship to children born outside Canada to them or adopted by them. If you think that this may apply to you and you would like more information, consult the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/index-featured-can.asp">Help Centre</a> at the end of this guide.</p>
