<p>When you become a Canadian citizen and are 18 years of age or older, you have the right to vote in federal elections and referendums. Elections Canada maintains the Register and uses it during a federal election or referendum to produce voter’s lists and to communicate with eligible voters.</p>
<p>The Canada Elections Act also allows Elections Canada to provide voter information to provincial and territorial election agencies for uses permitted under their respective legislations and to provide voter information (name, address, and sex only) to members of Parliament, registered political parties and candidates at election time. The UCI and the date your citizenship was granted will only be used by Elections Canada for administrative purposes, and will not be shared by Elections Canada except as required by law.</p>
<p>If you check Yes, IRCC will provide your name, residential and mailing address, sex, date of birth, UCI and the date your citizenship was granted to Elections Canada in order to add you to the Register, but only after you become a Canadian citizen. If you check No, IRCC will not provide your information to Elections Canada. You will still have the right to vote in federal elections and referendums, but you will have to take the necessary steps to be added to the list.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/documents/pdf/loi_elec_en.pdf" rel="external"><em>Election Act</em></a> allows the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec to:</p>

<li>provide voter information to provincial political parties and members of the National Assembly as well as municipal and school boards to compile and update lists of electors (voters) lists for municipal and school elections, and</li>
<li>notify the elector in writing that their name has been entered on the permanent list of electors, requesting that the elector correct or complete the information which concerns him/her, where required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chief Electoral Officer of Québec receives the UCI for administrative purposes only, while the date your citizenship was granted allows them to validate that you qualify as an elector based on the electoral laws it administers. This information is subject to no other use or communication.</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;provide this authorization, you will still be able to vote, but you will have to go to the revision office and present two supporting documents to register your name on the list of electors to be able to vote in a provincial, municipal or school election.</p>
