        <h3>What does it mean to sponsor parents and grandparents? </h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>When you sponsor persons who are members of the family class, you must sign an undertaking with the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (or with the <span lang="fr">Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Diversité et de l’Inclusion</span> [MIDI] if you live in Quebec).</p>
<p>The undertaking is a promise to provide financial support and basic requirements for the family members you are sponsoring.</p>
<p><strong>Basic requirements</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>food</li>
<li>clothing</li>
<li>utilities</li>
<li>personal requirements</li>
<li>shelter</li>
<li>fuel</li>
<li>household supplies</li>
</ul>
<p>This also includes other health care not provided by public health, such as eye and dental care.</p>
<p>The undertaking ensures that these persons and their family members do not have to apply for social assistance. The length of undertaking for sponsorship of parents, grandparents and their accompanying dependents is 20 years.</p>
<p>Your obligations as a sponsor begin as soon as the person you are sponsoring and, if applicable, his or her family members, arrive in Canada.</p>

For example, the granting of Canadian citizenship, divorce, separation or relationship breakdown or moving to another province does not cancel the undertaking. The undertaking also remains in effect even if your financial situation deteriorates.</p>

        <p>Your spouse or common-law partner may help you meet the income requirement by co-signing the sponsorship application. A common-law partner is a person who is living with you in a conjugal relationship and has done so for at least one year prior to the signing of the undertaking.</p>
<p>The co-signer must:</p>
<ul>
<li>meet the same eligibility requirements as the sponsor;</li>
<li>agree to co-sign the undertaking;</li>
<li>agree to be responsible for the basic requirements of the person you want to sponsor and his or her family members for the validity period of the undertaking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The co-signer will be equally liable if obligations are not performed.</p>
<p>If your co-signer is a common-law partner, you must submit the <a href="../../../../../content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5409e.pdf">Statutory Declaration of Common-Law Union (IMM 5409)</a>.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The size of the family determines the amount of income you need to make to sponsor. Use this table below to assist you in calculating the size of your family:</p>

<li>dependent children, if applicable. See the “<a href="#child">Definition of dependent child (types&nbsp;1 and 2)</a>”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Children who meet the definition of a dependent child must be included in the calculation, even if you as a sponsor do not have custody nor provide child support.</p>

<li><p>Count:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of persons you are now sponsoring and</li>
<li>all dependent family members of that person, whether or not they are accompanying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Count the number of persons covered by other <strong>valid undertakings you</strong> have made or co-signed in the past.</li>
<li>If you have a <strong>co-signer</strong>, count all persons covered by still <strong>valid undertakings</strong> made or co-signed by your co-signer.</li>
<li>Calculate the number of persons covered in steps&nbsp;1 to&nbsp;4. The total represents the family size</li>
<li>Look at the <a href="#table">Federal Income Table for Parents and Grandparents Sponsorship</a> in this guide to help you decide if you have the financial ability to meet sponsorship requirements. Note that your calculations will only be an estimate.</li>

        <p>If you are sponsoring a parent or a grandparent, you must meet the minimum necessary income requirement for each of the three taxation years immediately preceding the date of your application. The minimum necessary income requirement is equal to the Low Income Cut-offs (LICOs) plus 30%, taking into account the number of family members for whom you are or will be financially responsible.</p>
<p>Signing the statement of consent (question 8 on the <strong>Financial Evaluation for Parents and Grandparents Sponsorship</strong>) and providing your Social Insurance Number (SIN) will allow Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to collect your Social Insurance Number (SIN) and request your income tax information quickly from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to determine whether you meet the minimum necessary income requirements. If you do not provide your consent, you must complete the applicable form <strong>Income Sources for the Sponsorship of Parents and Grandparents</strong> and submit a Notice of Assessment issued to you by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for each of the three taxation years immediately preceding the date of your application. If you do not have paper copies of your Notices of Assessment on file, you can view (and print) your tax returns as well as other personal tax information using the CRA’s My Account online service. To register or login, visit <a href="../../../../revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.</p>
<p>If you reside anywhere in Canada, other than Quebec, you may use the&nbsp;<a href="#table">Federal Income Table</a> to estimate if your income is sufficient to meet income requirements to sponsor. If you have an eligible co-signer (spouse or common-law partner) on the sponsorship undertaking, their income will be added to yours as a sponsor.</p>
<p>If you reside in the province of Quebec, you will not be required to submit an undertaking of assistance for the family members you are sponsoring at this time. You will be contacted when your sponsorship application is assessed. At that time, if you meet federal sponsorship requirements, you will be notified that you must submit an <a href="http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/immigrate-settle/family-reunification/apply/undertaking-application/index.html">undertaking application</a> to the&nbsp;<span lang="fr">Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Diversité et de l’Inclusion</span> (MIDI)&nbsp;of Quebec so that your income can be assessed.</p>

<p>You are not obliged to hire a representative. We treat everyone equally, whether they use the service of a representative or not.</p> 
<p>When you appoint a representative:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>you also authorize IRCC and CBSA to share information from your case file with this person in place of you. <strong>Please note the representative will receive all correspondence from IRCC or the CBSA, not the applicant;</strong></li> 
 <li>your application will not be given special attention nor can you expect faster processing or a more favourable outcome;</li> 
 <li>the representative is authorized to represent you only on citizenship or immigration matters related to the application you submit with this form; and</li>

        <h5>Uncompensated Representatives:</h5> 
<p>Uncompensated representatives <strong>do not </strong>charge fees or receive any other form of consideration or compensation for providing advice or services to represent you before IRCC or the CBSA.</p> 
<p><strong>Uncompensated representatives include:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>friends and family members who do not, and will not, charge a fee or receive any other consideration for their advice and services;</li> 
 <li>organizations that do not, and will not, charge a fee or receive any other consideration for providing citizenship or immigration advice or assistance (such as a non-governmental or religious organization); </li> 
 <li>consultants, lawyers and Quebec notaries, and students-at-law under their supervision, who do not, and will not, charge a fee or receive any other consideration to represent you.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You do not have to pay someone for them to be your representative. IRCC will conduct business with an uncompensated representative if an applicant appoints them on their behalf.</p> 
<h5>Compensated representatives:</h5> 
<p>Compensated representatives charge a fee or receive some other form of consideration in exchange for the representation that they provide.</p> 
<p>It is important to know that anyone who represents or advises you for payment - or offers to do so - in connection with IRCC proceedings or applications is breaking the law <em>unless</em> they are an authorized representative or they have a specific agreement or arrangement with the Government of Canada that allows them to represent or advise you. This applies to advice or consultation which happens before or after a citizenship or an immigration application is made or a proceeding begins.</p> 
<p>IRCC will only conduct business with compensated representatives who are in good standing with their designated regulatory body. For more information see - <a href="../../immigration-citizenship-representative/choose/authorized.html">Find out if your representative is authorized</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a representative is being paid or compensated by someone other than you, the representative is still considered to be a compensated representative.</p> 
<p><strong>Authorized representatives are:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>consultants who are members in good standing of the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (ICCRC);</li> 
 <li>lawyers and paralegals who are members in good standing of a Canadian provincial or territorial law society and students-at-law under their supervision;</li> 
 <li>notaries who are members in good standing of the <em lang="fr">Chambre des notaires du Québec</em> and students-at-law under their supervision.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you appoint a compensated representative who is not a member in good standing of one of these designated bodies, your application will be returned. <a href="../../immigration-citizenship-representative.html">Learn about using a representative</a>.</p>
