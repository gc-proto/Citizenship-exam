<h2>Parties to the sponsorship</h2>
<p>Parties to the sponsorship (<strong>also known as sponsors or the sponsoring group</strong>) include every person who signs the Sponsorship Undertaking as part of a SAH sponsorship application.</p>
<h3>Sponsorship Agreement Holders (SAH)</h3>
<p>An organization that has signed a Sponsorship Agreement with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to help support refugees from abroad when they resettle in Canada. SAHs can sponsor refugees themselves or work with others in the community to sponsor refugees (Constituent Groups (CG) and/or co-sponsors). They are usually religious, ethnic, community or service organizations.</p>
<p>For dealings with IRCC, you have to authorize a person to act on your behalf, referred to as the Signing Authority:</p>
<ul>
<li>has the authority to submit sponsorship applications on behalf of your organization;</li>
<li>can legally bind your organization to the terms of the private sponsorship as part of the organization’s Sponsorship Agreement with IRCC; and</li>
<li>must submit a completed Sponsor Assessment Form (IMM 5492) to <a href="mailto:IRCC.INPSR-PPPRRI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca">IRCC.INPSR-PPPRRI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca</a> (required <strong>one</strong> time - this form will be kept on file).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constituent Groups (CG)</h3>
<p>A group authorized by a SAH to sponsor refugees under the Sponsorship Agreement. An example of a CG is a local congregation or chapter of a national church or organization that is a SAH.</p>
<p>For dealings with us, your CG has to authorize a person to act on their behalf, referred to as the Signing Authority:</p>
<ul>
<li>has the authority to submit sponsorship applications on behalf their group;</li>
<li>can legally bind their group to the terms of the private sponsorship; and</li>
<li>must submit a completed <a href="../../../../../content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5492e.pdf">Sponsor Assessment form (IMM 5492) <span data-aem-details="filedetails">(<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 664&nbsp;<abbr title="Kilobyte">KB</abbr>)</span></a> as part of <strong>each</strong> new sponsorship application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Co-Sponsors</h3>
<p>An individual or organization that partners with a SAH to help with settlement and provide support to the refugees. Co-sponsors can be family members of the refugees. The organizational co-sponsor must be an organization (for-profit or not), an association or a corporation (incorporated or not).</p>
<p>For dealings with us, your organizational co-sponsor has to authorize a person to act on their behalf, referred to as the Signing Authority:</p>
<ul>
<li>has the authority to submit sponsorship applications on behalf of their organization;</li>
<li>can legally bind their organization to the terms of the private sponsorship; and</li>
<li>must submit a completed <a href="../../../../../content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5492e.pdf">Sponsor Assessment form (IMM 5492) <span data-aem-details="filedetails">(<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 664&nbsp;<abbr title="Kilobyte">KB</abbr>)</span></a> as part of <strong>each</strong> new sponsorship application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="settlement">Other people involved in the sponsorship</h2>
<h3>Immigration Representative</h3>
<p>Applying to sponsor a refugee does not automatically authorize you to conduct business on their behalf. If the PA wants to authorize your group to do business with us on their behalf (provide us with updates about their situation), they must fill out the <a href="use-representative.html">Use of a Representative Form (IMM 5476)</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use this form to appoint a third-party immigration representative to represent you as the sponsor. The immigration representative will do business with us on your behalf. They can be an immigration consultant, lawyer, friend or family member. <a href="../../immigration-citizenship-representative.html">Find out about becoming or using an immigration representative</a>.</p>
<h3 id="residency">Representative in the expected community of settlement</h3>
<p>You must reside or have representatives in the community where the refugees expect to settle. See <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-29.html#h-80">section 153(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)</a> for more information. This means that one of the following persons or organizations must be based in the community where the refugees are expected to settle:</p>
<ul>
<li>the SAH and/or CG;</li>
<li>2 or more co-sponsors; or</li>
<li>2 or more <a href="#representative">representatives</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p id="representative"><strong>The representative:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lives in the PA’s expected community of settlement;</li>
<li>represents the sponsor in the community, according to the scope of representation agreed between the representative and the sponsor;</li>
<li>is not a party to the sponsorship (does not sign the Sponsorship Undertaking); and</li>
<li>while expected to help support the refugee, is not liable to fulfill the sponsorship obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>Appointing a representative does not diminish the sponsoring group’s obligations with IRCC. You must fulfill all responsibilities as per the Sponsorship Undertaking and outlined in the Settlement Plan. Everyone who signed the Sponsorship Undertaking remains equally responsible.</p>
<p><img alt="Required step" src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/stop_sm.gif" class="pull-left mrgn-rght-sm">To assess whether your sponsoring group meets the residency requirements, we will compare the sponsors’ addresses on the Sponsorship Undertaking (IMM 5373) <strong>or</strong> the representative’s address on the Appointment of Representative(s) in Expected Community of Settlement (IMM 5956) form with the province and city (where the refugees plan to live) listed in question 5 of the PA’s Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008). <strong>Your application will be refused if it does not meet residency requirements when you submit it to ROC-O.</strong></p>
<h2 id="member">Refugees who can be included in the PSR application</h2>
<h3>Principal Applicant (PA)</h3>
<p>When a family applies for permanent residence together, one family member must be the “principal” applicant. If the PA is applying with family members to immigrate to Canada, the PA is usually the head of family.</p>
<p>Under the Canadian immigration system, a family includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the PA;</li>
<li>the PA’s spouse or common-law partner;</li>
<li>the PA’s dependent child;</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s dependent child;</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s spouse/common-law partner; and</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s spouse/common-law partner’s dependent child.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-1.html#DefinedTerm">subsection 1(3) IRPR for the legal definition of the word “<strong>family member</strong>”</a>.

<h5>Use of a Representative (IMM 5476)</h5>
<p>Use this form to:</p>
<ol>
<li>authorize you (the sponsor) to do business on behalf of the refugees you are sponsoring (for example, to provide updated information about the refugee’s situation to the IRCC office overseas on their behalf):<ul>
<li>While this form is optional, <strong>we strongly recommend</strong> you include a Use of Representative form with each PSR application to authorize you to act on behalf of the refugees.</li>
<li>This authorization is different from the disclosure in section D of the refugee applicant’s Generic Application form for Canada IMM0008-Schedule 2 form, which authorizes us to share required case information with sponsors but does not authorize sponsors to act on the refugee’s behalf.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>authorize a third-party representative to do business on your behalf with IRCC and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and to give you advice or guidance during the application process.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the Use of Representative Guide and Form for instructions.</p>
<p>Do not use this form to appoint sponsorship representatives so that you can meet residency requirements. Instead, use the <a href="#imm5956">IMM 5956 Appointment of Representative(s) in Expected Community of Settlement form</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="next">What happens next?</h2>
<p>When ROC-O receives your sponsorship application, you can expect:</p>
<h3>Stage 1: Intake</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For mailed applications:</strong><ol>
<li>A first <strong>Acknowledgement of Receipt</strong> (AOR) is sent via email by ROC-O to the SAH signing authority to confirm that <strong>the sponsorship application package has been received but not yet verified</strong> for a completeness check. This AOR is generally sent within 30 days of reception of your application and includes the name of the PA. This AOR simply confirms that ROC-O received your application.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>For emailed applications:</strong><ol>
<li>An <strong>immediate auto-reply</strong> is sent to the email address from which the application was submitted. This auto-reply confirms that <strong>the sponsorship application package has been received</strong>. It does not confirm that your application is complete nor does it include the name of the PA.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stage 2: Completeness Check</h3>
<p>ROC-O reviews the application to ensure that all correct forms are submitted and signed by all sponsors.</p>
<p>If the <strong>application is complete</strong>, a <strong>second AOR</strong> is sent via email by ROC-O to the SAH Signing Authority to confirm that <strong>all necessary sponsorship forms are submitted and signed</strong> and that the application was created in our immigration system. You will receive your application number (G number) at this time. This also means that the application has been transferred to a ROC-O officer for decision and <strong>that a cap space has been taken from your allocation</strong>.</p>
<p>If the <strong>application is incomplete</strong>, no second AOR is sent. For a <strong>mailed application</strong>, the application will be returned to the SAH Signing Authority via mail. For an emailed application, an email will be sent to all sponsors and the PA explaining the reasons for return. Processing will not continue and <strong>no cap space will be taken from your allocation</strong>.</p>
<h3>Stage 3: The Sponsorship Application Decision</h3>
<p>At this stage, all complete applications will receive a final decision. A ROC-O Officer will assess your application by reviewing the application forms and your supporting documents to decide whether they are satisfied that you meet the requirements to be a sponsor under section R154 IRPR.</p>
<p><strong>If the ROC-O Officer is satisfied that you meet the requirements of IRPR</strong>, the Sponsorship Application will be <strong>approved</strong> and the decision will be communicated to all sponsors and the PA via email. The entire application (sponsorship application and the refugee’s application for permanent residence) will then be electronically transferred to the appropriate <a href="../../../corporate/contact-ircc/offices/international-visa-offices.html">IRCC office overseas</a>. For more information on how the application will be processed overseas, refer to the <a href="guide-6000-convention-refugees-abroad-humanitarian-protected-persons-abroad.html">Guide IMM 6000 – Convention Refugees Abroad and Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If the ROC-O officer is not satisfied that you meet the requirements of IRPR</strong>, the application will be <strong>refused</strong> and the decision will be communicated to all sponsors and the PA via e-mail. <strong>Cap space used for this application will not be returned to your SAH. We strongly encourage sponsors to keep a copy of each application submitted to IRCC, as applications approved, withdrawn, or refused cannot be returned to you.</strong></p>
<p>If your application is returned or refused and you wish to re-submit it, you <strong>must</strong> submit a new and complete application. You cannot simply include the missing documents or updated documents from the previous submission.</p>
<h2 id="information">Updating your contact information</h2>
<p>During the sponsorship application process, you must notify us of any change in your contact information, or the contact information of your CG or co-sponsors (address, phone number, <strong>new email address</strong> etc). Notify us by emailing <a href="mailto:IRCC.INPSR-PPPRRI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca">IRCC.INPSR-PPPRRI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca</a>.</p>
<p>The PA must contact the IRCC office overseas to change their or their family members’ contact information (email address) or changes to their personal circumstances (for example, change in your marital status, <strong>birth of a child, email address</strong>). Find out how to <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp">Change your address</a>.</p>
<h2>Checking your application status</h2>
<p>Once we have created your application in our immigration system, you can <a href="../check-status.html">check its status on-line</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like a case status update, you can contact ROC-O at <a href="mailto:IRCC.INROCO-CORORI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca">IRCC.INROCO-CORORI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca</a>. Use this email subject line when sending a status inquiry: PA FAMILY NAME, first name, G number, CASE STATUS REQUEST.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>contacting ROC-O always takes us away from processing applications</strong>. Receiving a high volume of case status updates delays processing of your application and applications of others.</p>
<p>You should contact ROC-O when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You sent an <strong>email application</strong> and you did not receive the automatic auto-reply. Carefully review the email address from which you sent your application and your junk mail folder.</li>
<li>More than 60 days have passed since you submitted your paper application and you have not received the first AOR;</li>
<li>More than 6 months have passed since you received your first AOR. <strong>If less than 6 months have passed since you received your first AOR from ROC-O, we will not answer your case status request</strong>;</li>
<li>If you believe that your application has been erroneously delayed overseas, ROC-O will review the case and advise the mission if an error seems to have occurred in processing the application. <strong>ROC-O will not provide you with a response on these case status requests.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to send us an email, please do not ask your Member of Parliament (MP), other sponsors or the PA to send an email for the same question. If ROC-O receives multiple email enquiries on the same topic, we will only answer the first email that we received.</p>
<h2>Current processing times</h2>
<p>Processing times can change. You can check current processing times on the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/index.asp">Application processing times webpage</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="appa">Appendix A – Financial Guidelines</h2>
<p>These guidelines are intended to help sponsoring groups to plan for sponsorship costs when preparing their Sponsorship Applications for submission to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). <strong>For detailed information on financial support that should be provided after the refugees have arrived, see the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program FAQS – Post-Arrival Financial Support for PSRs.</strong></p>
<h3>General Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsoring groups will not:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>profit financially by sponsoring refugees.</li>
<li>accept funds from the refugees for any of the situations below, either before or after the refugees arrive in Canada:<ul>
<li>as payment for submitting a sponsorship;</li>
<li>as a prepayment or repayment for lodging, care and settlement assistance;</li>
<li><p>as a deposit to guarantee the refugees will stay with the sponsor for one year after they arrive.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The refugee’s relatives or friends may contribute their own funds to the sponsoring group to help with resettlement costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>act as paid representatives and charge associated fees;</li>
<li>require that refugees, their relatives or friends use services of a paid representative for the purpose of a Sponsorship Application.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You are not responsible to cover the costs of the refugee’s Immigration Loan, or for any debt that a refugee incurs in Canada, unless you have co-signed loans.</p>
<h3>How long to provide financial support</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should provide income support to at least the equivalent amount that is provided by the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) in the expected community of settlement, adjusted by any eligible <a href="#contributions">in-kind contributions</a>. You should support the refugee towards becoming self-sufficient. This can include enrolling the refugees in language training or employment counseling before encouraging them to find employment.</li>
<li>You need to provide the refugee with both financial and non-financial support (including start-up costs) for:<ul>
<li>up to 12 months or until the refugee becomes self-sufficient, whichever comes first;</li>
<li>up to 6 months or until the refugee becomes self-sufficient, whichever comes first, for cases sponsored under the Blended Visa Office Referred (BVOR) Program (IRCC will cover an additional 6 months).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the refugee becomes financially self-sufficient during the 12-month sponsorship period, your sponsoring group does not have to provide income support under the terms of the Sponsorship Undertaking for the rest of the sponsorship period. A definition of financial self-sufficiency can be found here.</li>
<li>In case the refugee stops being self-sufficient, your sponsoring group must make sure you can afford to start supporting them again for the remaining length of the sponsorship.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trust Funds and Funds held in Trust</h3>
<p>There are two different types of financial accounts that sponsors may establish: 1) a formal trust fund; or 2) funds deposited into a chequing or savings account at a Canadian financial institution (funds held in trust). For both types of accounts, funds can be contributed by individuals, groups, and organizations, but refugees cannot contribute any funds. In the event that the refugee is not accepted for resettlement to Canada, funds held in trust for the sponsorship of that refugee, including all accumulated interest, must be returned to the contributors.</p>
<h4>1) Formal trust fund</h4>
<p>Sponsoring groups may establish a formal trust fund with a Canadian financial institution. The individual rights and obligations of the contributors, sponsors and beneficiaries must be set out in the terms of the trust.</p>
<h4>2) Funds deposited into a bank account (funds held in trust)</h4>
<p>This account does not need to be a formal trust account; a chequing or savings account held with a Canadian financial institution is sufficient, provided there is a minimum of two account holders.</p>
<h3>Administrative Fees</h3>
<p>As per the Sponsorship Agreement, SAHs may recover a one-time maximum payment of $250 <strong>per application</strong> from the Constituent Group (CG) or co-sponsor for direct administrative costs incurred in support of the application. Direct administrative costs include rent, staff, accounting fees, telephone, facsimile, postage, courier and photocopying. As per the Sponsorship Agreement, SAHs must maintain for one year a record of all fees collected. These costs cannot be imposed on or required from the refugees.</p>
<h3>Cost of Sponsorship</h3>
<p>You should provide income support to at least the equivalent amount that is provided by the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) in the expected community of settlement, adjusted by any eligible <a href="#contributions">in-kind contributions</a>. Use the <a href="http://www.rstp.ca/en/sponsorship-responsibilities/resettlement-assistance-program-rap-rates/">RAP rates in the expected community of settlement</a> to calculate the income support you will have to prepare to give.</p>
<p>Sponsorship costs include start-up costs and monthly costs.</p>
<p><strong>Start-up costs</strong> include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>one-time payment for household items (basic window coverings and common household products such as kitchen utensils, pots, pans, brooms, mops, detergents and cleansers, etc.);</li>
<li>furniture (beds, mattresses, dining set, couches, end table and lamps, etc.);</li>
<li>linens (including bedding);</li>
<li>food staples;</li>
<li>both regular and winter clothing;</li>
<li>school registration fees (if applicable).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monthly costs</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>food and incidentals;</li>
<li>housing costs (including utilities);</li>
<li>monthly public transportation passes for all adults;</li>
<li>a communication allowance to cover the costs of a telephone and/or internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the costs above, you should plan to cover deposits for utilities, phone installation and rental deposit.</p>
<p>Some factors, such as in-kind donations or special needs, may impact the amount you need.</p>
<p>You should consider these specific needs in your cost estimate:</p>
<ul>
<li>maternity benefits,</li>
<li>child care,</li>
<li>disability,</li>
<li>age-specific top-ups,</li>
<li>housing supplements,</li>
<li>health-related expenses, such as travel to appointments, and</li>
<li>critical health related expenses not covered through Interim Federal Health (IFH) or provincial health insurance plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>For RAP rates in your community, refer to the <a href="http://www.rstp.ca/en/sponsorship-responsibilities/resettlement-assistance-program-rap-rates/">Resettlement Sponsorship Training Program (RSTP)</a>.</p>
<h3>Family Composition</h3>
<p>If there are linked Sponsorship Applications (including for adult children), you should estimate the costs for each family separately, even if the families intend to live together in Canada. Any adult children over the age of majority in the province they are expected to live are entitled to receive adult benefit rates, adjusted by in-kind contributions.</p>
<h3>Income Support Deductions</h3>
<ul>
<li>The standards for using personal funds and earned income follow the same standards as the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP); however, you may choose to maintain a higher level of income support.</li>
<li>As the refugee starts to earn money, you may be able to lower the monthly financial support.<ul>
<li>Once their net earned income is 50% higher than the RAP rates, you may reduce your support. The total income they earn and get from you must still be at least the minimum they need.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a tax-free monthly payment made to eligible families to help with the cost of raising children under 18. The CCB:<ul>
<li>is available to all Permanent Residents and Canadian Citizens;</li>
<li>can’t be counted as earned income;</li>
<li>can’t be used to calculate reductions to sponsor support;</li>
<li>can’t be counted towards the financial support requirements under the Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program;</li>
<li>has no impact on the minimum amount of financial support a sponsor is required to provide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional guidance on post-arrival financial support can be found here.</p>
<h3 id="contributions">In–Kind donations</h3>
<p>In-kind donations include all donated goods, commodities or services (e.g. gently used furniture or clothing, or housing provided at no cost to the sponsored family). In-kind donations cannot be valued for more than their actual value or the financial benefit they are replacing.</p>
<p>Some items cannot be donated, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>mattresses, which should always be purchased new;</li>
<li>opened food products; and</li>
<li>personal clothing items such as undergarments or footwear.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can subtract the following types and values of in-kind donations from your estimated sponsorship costs.</p>

        <h2 id="appb">Appendix B - Add a family member to a privately-sponsored refugee application</h2>
<p>Both accompanying and non-accompanying family members (also known as dependants) <strong>must</strong> be added to an application for permanent residence <strong>before the PA departs for Canada</strong>.</p>
<p>Failing to declare a family member may result in the refusal of your application. Declaring family members is also important for family reunification. For example, under the One Year Window (OYW) of opportunity provision, the PA can apply to bring their non-accompanying family members to Canada for up to one year after their arrival in Canada, but <strong>only</strong> if they were declared on the application <strong>before</strong> the PA departed for Canada. For more information about the OYW provision, see the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5578-request-process-following-family-members-year-window-opportunity-provisions.html">OYW Application Guide (IMM 5578)</a>.</p>
<p>Before you or the PA add a family member, <strong>carefully review</strong> the definition of what constitutes a family member under IRPR. <strong>De facto family members are not family members under the regulations and cannot be added to a sponsorship application.</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to add an accompanying de facto family member, a separate Sponsorship Application package is required. You can link the application by listing it in the Linked/Multiple Sponsorship Undertakings section on the Sponsorship Undertaking form. We will do our best to process the applications at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>If you are adding a:</strong></p>
<h3>1. Newborn biological child</h3>
<p>If a biological child is born after the PA’s application was received at ROC-O, as per the Sponsorship Undertaking form (IMM 5373 - section F Obligations, Consents and Declarations) that you signed, you are automatically responsible for this child as part of your obligations to sponsor. You do <strong>not</strong> need to add this child on a new Sponsorship Undertaking form or submit the Request to Add Family Members to a Private Sponsorship Undertaking form (IMM 5618).</p>
<p>The process to add a biological child after the application was received at ROC-O is the following:</p>
<p><strong>If you, the sponsor, notifies ROC-O:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor submits the following documents to ROC-O <strong>(<a href="#mailing">preferably via email</a>)</strong>:<ul>
<li>an updated Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008) signed by the PA that includes the PA, previously declared and new family members; and</li>
<li>a <strong>copy</strong> of the child’s birth certificate and/or new family UNHCR document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the PA notifies the IRCC office overseas:</strong></p>
