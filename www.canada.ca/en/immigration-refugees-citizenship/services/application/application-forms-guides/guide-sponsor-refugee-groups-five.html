        <h2>Parties to the sponsorship</h2>
<p>Parties to the sponsorship (<strong>also known as group members, sponsors or the sponsoring group</strong>) include every person who signs the Sponsorship Undertaking as part of a Group of Five (G5) sponsorship application.</p>
<h3>Definition of Group of Five (G5)</h3>
<p>Any group of five or more Canadian citizens, Registered Indians, or permanent residents who are 18&nbsp;years of age or older and who live (or have representatives) in the community where the refugees are expected to live. Sponsors act as guarantors that the necessary settlement support will be provided for the full duration of the sponsorship. The sponsorship group must show that it has the necessary financial resources, expertise and commitment required to fulfill the terms of the Sponsorship Undertaking.</p>
<h3>Other people involved in a sponsorship</h3>
<h4>Immigration Representative</h4>
<p>Applying to sponsor a refugee does not automatically authorize you to conduct business on their behalf. If the PA wants to authorize your group to do business with us on their behalf (provide us with updates about their situation), they must fill out the <a href="use-representative.html">Use of a Representative Form</a>&nbsp;(IMM 5476).</p>
<p>You can also use this form to appoint a third-party immigration representative to represent you as the sponsor. The immigration representative will do business with us on your behalf. They can be an immigration consultant, lawyer, friend or family member. <a href="../../immigration-citizenship-representative.html">Find out about using an immigration representative</a>.</p>
<h4 id="residency_requirements">Representative in the expected community of settlement</h4>
<p>You must reside or have representatives in the community where the refugees expect to settle.&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-29.html#h-80">See section 153(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations</a> (IRPR) for more information. This means that one of the following persons must be based in the community where the refugees are expected to settle:</p>
<ul>
<li>all G5 group members; or</li>
<li>1 representative for each group member that does not reside in the expected community of settlement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The representative:</p>
<ul>
<li>lives in the PA’s expected community of settlement;</li>
<li>represents the sponsor in the community, according to the scope of representation agreed between the representative and the sponsor;</li>
<li>is not a party to the sponsorship (does not sign the Sponsorship Undertaking); and</li>
<li>while expected to help support the refugee, is not liable to fulfill the sponsorship obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>Appointing a representative does not diminish the sponsoring group’s obligations with IRCC. You must fulfill all responsibilities as per the Sponsorship Undertaking and outlined in the Settlement Plan. Everyone who signed the Sponsorship Undertaking remains equally responsible.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/stop_sm.gif" alt="stop sign">To assess whether your sponsoring group meets the residency requirements, we will compare the sponsors’ addresses on the Sponsorship Undertaking (IMM 5670) <strong>or</strong> the representative’s address on the Appointment of Representative(s) in Expected Community of Settlement (IMM 5956) form with the province and city (where the refugees plan to live) listed in question 5 of the PA’s Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008).&nbsp;<strong>Your application will be refused if it does not meet residency requirements when you submit it to us</strong>.</p>
<h2>Refugees who can be included in the PSR application</h2>
<h3>Principal Applicant (PA):</h3>
<p>When a family applies for permanent residence together, one family member must be the “principal” applicant. If the PA is applying with family members to immigrate to Canada, the PA is usually the head of family.</p>
<p>Under the Canadian immigration system, a family includes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the PA;</li>
<li>the PA’s spouse or common-law partner;</li>
<li>the PA’s dependent child;</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s dependent child;</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s spouse/common-law partner; and</li>
<li>the dependent child of the PA’s spouse/common-law partner’s dependent child.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-1.html#h-2">See subsection 1(3) IRPR</a> for the legal definition of the word “<strong>family member</strong>”. You can also refer to the Guide for Convention Refugees and Humanitarian – Protected Persons Abroad (IMM 6000)</p>
<h2>Steps to sponsor a refugee</h2>
<p>If you do not already have a refugee to sponsor, we can match you with one. Find out about the <a href="../../refugees/help-outside-canada/private-sponsorship-program/blended-visa-office-program.html">Blended Visa Office-Referred (BVOR) Program</a>.</p>

        <h4>1. Proof of Canadian citizenship, Indian status or permanent residence status</h4>
<p>Each sponsor must provide proof of their legal status in Canada by submitting <strong>a copy</strong> of one of the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canadian Passport;</li>
<li>Canadian provincial or territorial birth certificate;</li>
<li>Canadian citizenship certificate (card or paper certificate);</li>
<li>Canadian certificate of registration of birth abroad;</li>
<li>Record of Landing (IMM 1000);</li>
<li>Confirmation of Permanent Residence (IMM 5292 or IMM 5688);</li>
<li>Permanent Resident Card;</li>
<li>Indian status card (formerly known as a Certificate of Indian status).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/stop_sm.gif" alt="stop sign">We do not accept driver’s licenses and health cards as valid proof of Canadian citizenship or permanent residence.</p>
<h4>2. Criminal Record Check</h4>
<p>Each sponsor must submit a copy of a criminal record check (non-vulnerable sector check) issued within 6 months prior to of the application submission to ROC-O. If you have a criminal conviction, include applicable police and court documents which show the disposition of your charges.</p>
<p>For information on how to obtain a criminal record check, contact your local police department.</p>
<h4>3. Proof of funds</h4>
<p>The ROC-O officer must assess whether your sponsoring group has the financial resources to fulfil the settlement plan for the duration of the undertaking as per <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-29.html#h-80">R154(1)(a) IRPR</a>. <strong>The funds cannot come from the refugees</strong>.</p>
<p>To assess your financial capacity to sponsor, the ROC-O officer will review the forms and all the financial documents you submitted. You are required to submit sufficient information and evidence to demonstrate that you have sufficient financial means to fulfil the settlement plan. <strong>If the ROC-O officer cannot establish, based on your submission, whether you have enough money to cover the costs of the sponsorship, your application will be refused</strong>.</p>
<p>As a G5 sponsor, you have three options to demonstrate that you have the necessary funds for your sponsorship:</p>
<ul>
<li>your group hold funds held in trust in a financial institution;</li>
<li>group members are contributing to the sponsorship with their personal income (at least 3 group members);</li>
<li>your group is using a combination of both.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sponsors submitting funds held in trust:</h5>
<p>If your group has collected funds to contribute towards the cost of the sponsorship, these funds should be deposited to an account held at a Canadian financial institution. This account does not need to be a formal trust account; a chequing or savings account is sufficient, provided there are a <strong>minimum of two account holders</strong>. Funds collected for different sponsorship applications <strong>cannot</strong> be combined into one account. Instead, the intended financial contributions for each sponsorship application must be deposited into separate accounts.</p>
<p>If your group decides to submit funds in trust, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide an <strong>original</strong> letter from a financial institution attesting to the bank account details;<ul>
<li>the letter must be issued no more than <strong>six months</strong> before the date you submit your application and must indicate the:<ul>
<li>name of the Canadian financial institution;</li>
<li>names of the account holders (minimum of two);</li>
<li>account number;</li>
<li>current account balance; and<br>
</li>
<li>must be signed and stamped by an employee of the institution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide <strong>the most recent account statements</strong> signed and stamped by an employee of the financial institution.&nbsp;The statement must indicate the account number, account holders’ names and branch information.</li>
<li><strong>explain how you gathered the funds </strong>(for example, fund raising activities, if funds were provided by the sponsors, PA’s family members, etc.);</li>
<li><strong>provide proof of how the funds were obtained</strong> (details of deposits, bank statements, statements from fund raising activities, etc.)<ul>
<li>if the funds come from a group member, you must provide proof of income – see group members contributing personal income below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your sponsoring group decides to use funds held in trust to cover the costs of the sponsorship, an officer will assess whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>the total funds held in trust meet the minimum financial requirement;</li>
<li>the in-kind deductions respect the maximum allowable deductions;</li>
<li>the letter from the financial institution meets the criteria outlined above;</li>
<li>the sponsors explained how the funds held in trust were obtained and whether the explanation is credible;</li>
<li>the sponsors submitted credible documents to demonstrate how the funds were obtained.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Group members contributing personal income:</h5>
<p>Your group can contribute funds from a group member’s personal income. If your group’s financial support is based <strong>solely</strong> on contributing funds from your group members’ personal income, <strong>at least three sponsors must contribute</strong> towards the financial commitment.</p>
<p>As proof of funds, the most conclusive document is a copy of your <strong>most recent </strong>Notice of Assessment issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). We will also consider the following documents:</p>
<ul class="lst-lwr-alph">
<li>a copy of your most recent T4 Statement of Remuneration Paid form;</li>
<li>a copy of your most recent T5 Statement of Investment Income form;</li>
<li>pension statements that confirm your annual revenue for the last 12 months;</li>
<li>employment Insurance pay stubs that confirm revenue obtained under this program within the last 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following documents are <strong>not</strong> considered adequate proof of income:</p>
<ul>
<li>T1 General Returns, Forms and Schedules;</li>
<li>T2 Corporation Income declaration form;</li>
<li>letters of employment;</li>
<li>pay stubs;</li>
<li>investment portfolios;</li>
<li>letters from a Canadian financial institution attesting to bank account details.</li>
</ul>
<p>If group members decide to use their personal income to cover the costs of the sponsorship, an officer will assess whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>each contributing group member submitted their Financial Profile form (IMM5373B)</li>
<li>each contributing group member submitted <strong>credible</strong> financial documents that show that they have the financial capacity to contribute to the sponsorship. The documents must be as recent as possible and should be issued by the federal government;</li>
<li>the in-kind deductions respect the maximum allowable deductions;</li>
<li>at least 3 group members contributed funds from their personal income (if no funds in trust are contributed).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the ROC-O officer is satisfied of the above then they will individually assess each sponsor who is contributing funds by using this formula:</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong></p>
<p>The group member’s <strong>gross</strong> annual income.</p>
<p><strong>Minus</strong></p>
<p>The group member’s annual cost of living based on family size. For more information, refer to the Sponsorship Cost Table in Appendix A. To know your family size, we will review the number you have provided on your Financial Profile form (IMM 5373B) in section B (Financial Capacity) and any ongoing family class sponsorship applications you may have for your spouse and/or children in our database. If the number in our database is higher than the number on the Financial Profile form, we will use the number in our database to assess your cost of living.</p>
<p><strong>Minus</strong></p>
<p>The group member’s financial contributions to other PSR sponsorships. This includes applications currently being processed and/or sponsorships for which the refugee has arrived in Canada in the last year. This information is available in our database.</p>
<p><strong>Minus</strong></p>
<p>The group member’s financial commitment towards the current application.</p>
<p><strong>Remaining income</strong></p>
<p>If the remaining income is higher than zero, then this group member has sufficient income available to contribute towards the sponsorship.</p>
<p><strong>Total funds contributed by the group</strong></p>
<p>After the assessment of the financial capacity of each group member, if the total of funds contributed by group members plus the in-kind deduction and funds held in trust (if applicable) is equal to or higher than the sponsorship cost table then the group meets the financial assessment.</p>
<h4>4. Proof of refugee status recognition:</h4>
<p>You can <strong>only</strong> sponsor someone who is <strong>recognized as a refugee</strong> by the UNHCR or by the government authorities of the country in which they currently live (whichever is authorized to do so).</p>
<p>After a person has been assessed and recognized as a refugee, they get a document attesting to their Refugee Status Determination (RSD).&nbsp; The name and format of this document varies depending on the country of issue.</p>
<p>As part of your application, you must include an RSD issued by the UNHCR or a foreign state with the application. <strong>Do not submit the original document</strong>.</p>
<p>A “UNHCR Asylum Seeker Certificate”, a document indicating “UNHCR Registration” or documents issued by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNWRA) are not valid proof of refugee recognition.</p>

<h6>Section E – Settlement Checklist</h6>
<p>Check the box to tell us who will provide for the settlement needs of the refugees. The boxes checked in section E should align with the details of the sponsorship plan in section D.</p>
<h6>Section F – Financial Assessment</h6>
<p><strong>i. Minimum Financial Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The family size and minimum financial requirement will be automatically calculated based on the information you enter in section B. <strong>These amounts include non-accompanying family members.</strong></p>
<p>The minimum financial requirement reflects the minimum amount of annual funds your group must commit to be approved to sponsor. This amount is based on the Sponsorship Cost Tables in Appendix A and includes ongoing monthly expenses and one-time start-up costs.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Estimated living costs in the expected community of settlement</strong></p>
<p>In this section you will create a budget based on annual estimated settlement costs for the refugees. The budget includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>start-up costs (items purchased once to help the refugees become established), and</li>
<li>on-going monthly costs (including rent, food, phone and internet, pocket money and allowances and transportation costs).</li>
</ul>
<p>For one-time start-up costs, enter the estimated amount for each item.</p>
<p>For ongoing monthly costs, enter the estimated monthly cost. The annual cost column and total annual living costs will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/stop_sm.gif" alt="stop sign">The total annual living costs you budget for MUST be greater than or equal to the minimum financial requirement in section F (i).</p>
<p><strong>iii. Donations</strong></p>
<p>In this section, you can deduct costs for items you are donating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the In-kind Deduction Table in <a href="#appendixA">Appendix A</a></li>
<li>Enter the in-kind deduction amount for each donated item</li>
<li>Pay attention to the maximum allowable deductions for each item</li>
<li>If the amount you enter is more than the maximum allowable deduction for the family size, you will get an error message and that amount will be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iv. Financial Requirement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This section will automatically calculate your total financial requirement for sponsorship by subtracting the in-kind deductions from the estimated annual living costs.</li>
<li>If your estimated annual living costs are less than the minimum financial requirement in section F (i), the minimum financial requirement will be used for the calculation instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v. Total Committed Funds</strong></p>
<p>In this section, your group must enter the amount of money each group member is committing and/or the funds held in trust your group is providing towards the sponsorship.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/stop_sm.gif" alt="stop sign"><strong>If you are contributing funds in trust, explain how they were obtained and submit proof. If you do not explain how the funds were obtained, your application will most likely be refused.</strong></p>
<p>If you are contributing personal income, enter the amount.</p>
<p><strong>vi. Assessment of Financial Capacity</strong></p>
<p>This section will indicate if your group has enough funds to sponsor. The form will automatically subtract the Financial Requirement in section F (iv) from the Committed Funds in section F (v).</p>
<ul>
<li>If your group has committed enough funds, the balance will be positive and a checkmark will appear.</li>
<li>If your group has not committed enough funds, the balance will be negative and an X will appear. <strong>The sponsorship application will be refused if the group has not committed sufficient funds.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h6>Section G – Obligations, Consent and Declarations</h6>
<p><strong>This section must be read carefully and understood by all parties to the sponsorship.</strong></p>
<h6>Section H - Signatures</h6>
<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/stop_sm.gif" alt="stop sign">Each sponsor <strong>must sign</strong> and <strong>date</strong> the application. By signing here, the sponsoring group declares that they understand and commit to upholding the terms outlined on the Sponsorship Undertaking. <strong>If a signature is missing, the application will be returned to you without being processed</strong>. We accept scanned signatures.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/stop_sm.gif" alt="stop sign"><strong>Note: Your application will be returned to you if the Sponsorship Undertaking (IMM 5670):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is not signed <strong>and</strong> dated by all the relevant parties;</li>
<li>Is dated more than 90 days prior to the date of submission to ROC-O;</li>
<li>If the PA and family member information does not match the Generic Application Form (IMM 0008).</li>
</ul>
<p>As the sponsors, you must ensure that all the information contained in the application is accurate at the time of submission at ROC-O. Failure to do so will most likely result in the refusal of your application.&nbsp;Although we allow the Sponsorship Undertaking to be signed within 90 days of the submission date, if there are changes to your sponsoring group’s composition or changes to your PA’s family composition within this 90 day period, you must complete, sign and date a new Sponsorship Undertaking before submitting your application to ROC-O.</p>

        <h3 id="what_happens_next">What happens next?</h3>
<p>When ROC-O receives your application, you can expect:</p>
<h4>Stage 1: Intake:</h4>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li><strong>For mailed applications</strong>:<ol>
<li>A first <strong>Acknowledgement of Receipt</strong> (AOR) email is sent by ROC-O to the individual listed as group member #1 on the Sponsorship Undertaking to confirm that <strong>the sponsorship application package has been received but not yet verified</strong> for completeness. This AOR is <strong>generally</strong> sent within 30 days of receipt of your application and includes the name of the PA. This AOR simply confirms that ROC-O received your application.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>For emailed applications</strong>:<ol start="2">
<li>An <strong>immediate auto-reply</strong> is sent to the email address from which the application was submitted.&nbsp;This email confirms that<strong> the sponsorship application package has been received.&nbsp;</strong>It does not confirm that your application is complete nor does it include the name of the PA.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stage 2: Completeness Check:</h4>
<p>ROC-O reviews the application to ensure that all correct forms are submitted and signed by the group members. <strong>At this stage, there is no verification as to whether the group members submitted all supporting documents necessary to assess the application</strong> (such as proof of funds).</p>
<p><strong>If the application is complete</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>second AOR</strong> is sent via email by ROC-O to the individual listed as group member #1 to confirm that <strong>all of the necessary sponsorship forms are submitted and signed</strong> and that the application was created in our electronic system.&nbsp;You will receive your application number (G number) at this time. This also means that the application has been transferred to a ROC-O officer for decision.</p>
<p><strong>If the application is incomplete</strong>, no second AOR is sent. For a <strong>mailed application</strong>, the application will be returned to the individual listed as the group member #1 via mail. For an emailed application, an email will be sent to all group members and the PA explaining the reasons for return. Processing will not continue.</p>
<h4>Stage 3: The Sponsorship Application Decision</h4>
<p>At this stage, all complete applications will receive a final decision. A ROC-O officer will assess your application by reviewing the application forms and your supporting documents to decide whether they are satisfied that you meet the requirements to be a sponsor under <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-29.html#h-80">section R154 IRPR</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If the ROC-O officer is satisfied that you meet the requirements of IRPR,</strong> the sponsorship application will be <strong>approved</strong> and the decision will be communicated to all group members and the PA via email.&nbsp;The entire application (sponsorship application and the refugee’s application for permanent residence) will then be electronically transferred to the <a href="../../../corporate/contact-ircc/offices/international-visa-offices.html">appropriate IRCC office overseas</a>. For more information on how the application will be processed overseas, refer to the <a href="guide-6000-convention-refugees-abroad-humanitarian-protected-persons-abroad.html">Guide IMM 6000 - Convention Refugees Abroad and Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If the ROC-O officer is not satisfied that you meet the requirements of IRPR, </strong>the application will be <strong>refused</strong> and the decision will be communicated to all group members and the PA via e-mail. <strong>Any refused applications will not be returned;</strong> IRCC is obligated to retain all applications for which a decision has been made. <strong>We strongly encourage sponsors to keep a copy of each application submitted to IRCC, as applications approved, withdrawn or refused cannot be returned to you.</strong></p>
<p>If your application is returned or refused and you wish to re-submit it, you must submit a new and complete application. You cannot simply include the missing documents or updated documents from the previous submission.</p>
<h4>Updating your contact information</h4>
<p>During the sponsorship application process, you must notify us of any change in any group member’s contact information (address, phone number, new email address etc). Notify us by filling out the Case Specific Inquiry (https://secure.cic.gc.ca/enquiries- renseignements/canada-case-cas-eng.aspx) tool.</p>
<p>The PA must contact the IRCC office overseas to change their or their family members’ contact information (email address) or changes to their personal circumstances (for example, change in your marital status, <strong>birth of a child, email address</strong>). <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp">Find out how to change your address</a> page.</p>
<h4>Checking your application status</h4>
<p>Once we have created your application in our immigration system, you can <a href="../check-status.html">check its status on-line</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like a case status update, you can contact ROC-O at (<a href="mailto:IRCC.INROCO-CORORI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca">IRCC.INROCO-CORORI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca</a>). Use this email subject line when sending a status inquiry: PA FAMILY NAME, first name, G number, CASE STATUS REQUEST.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>contacting ROC-O always takes us away from processing applications</strong>. Receiving a high volume of case status updates delays processing of your application and applications of others.</p>
<p>You should contact ROC-O when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You sent an <strong>email application</strong> and you did not receive the automatic auto-reply. Carefully review the email address from which you sent your application and your junk mail folder.</li>
<li>More than 60 days have passed since you submitted your paper application and you have not received the first AOR;</li>
<li>More than 6 months have passed since you received your first AOR. <strong>If less than 6 months have passed since you received your first AOR from ROC-O, we will not answer your case status request</strong>;</li>
<li>If you believe that your application has been erroneously delayed overseas, ROC-O will review the case and advise the mission if an error seems to have occurred in processing the application. <strong>ROC-O will not provide you with a response on these case status requests</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to send us an email, please do not ask your Member of Parliament (MP), other sponsors or the PA to send an email for the same question. If ROC-O receives multiple email enquiries on the same topic, we will only answer the first email that we received.</p>
<h4>Current processing times</h4>
<p>Processing times can change. You can check current processing times on the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/index.asp">Application processing times</a> webpage.</p>

<h3 id="appendixA">Appendix A: Financial Guidelines</h3>
<p>These guidelines are intended to help sponsoring groups to plan for sponsorship costs when preparing their Sponsorship Applications for submission to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). <strong>For detailed information on financial support that should be provided after the refugees have arrived, see the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program FAQS – Post-Arrival Financial Support for PSRs.</strong></p>
<h4>General Requirements</h4>
<p><strong>Sponsoring groups will not:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>profit financially by sponsoring refugees;</li>
<li>accept funds from the refugees for any of the situations below, either before or after the refugees arrive in Canada:<ul>
<li>as payment for submitting a sponsorship</li>
<li>as a prepayment or repayment for lodging, care and settlement assistance</li>
<li>as a deposit to guarantee the refugees will stay with the sponsor for one year after they arrive.<p><strong>Note:</strong> The refugee’s relatives or friends may contribute their own funds to the sponsoring group to help with resettlement costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>act as paid representatives and charge associated fees;</li>
<li>require that refugees, their relatives or friends use services of a paid representative for the purpose of a Sponsorship Application.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You are not responsible to cover the costs of the refugee’s Immigration Loan, or for any debt that a refugee incurs in Canada, unless you have co-signed loans.</p>
<h4>How long to provide financial support</h4>
<ul>
<li>You should provide income support to at least the equivalent amount that is provided by the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) in the expected community of settlement, adjusted by any eligible <a href="#inkind">in-kind contributions</a>. You should support the refugee towards becoming self-sufficient. This can include enrolling the refugees in language training or employment counseling before encouraging them to find employment.</li>
<li>You need to provide the refugee with both financial and non-financial support (including start-up costs) for:<ul>
<li>up to 12 months or until the refugee becomes self-sufficient, whichever comes first</li>
<li>up to 6 months or until the refugee becomes self-sufficient, whichever comes first, for cases sponsored under the Blended Visa Office Referred (BVOR) Program (IRCC will cover an additional 6 months).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the refugee becomes financially self-sufficient during the 12-month sponsorship period, your sponsoring group does not have to provide income support under the terms of the Sponsorship Undertaking for the rest of the sponsorship period. A definition of financial self-sufficiency can be found <a href="http://www.rstp.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FAQs-Financial-Requirements-for-Sponsoring-Groups_E.pdf" rel="external">here (PDF, 61.1 KB)</a>.</li>
<li>In case the refugee stops being self-sufficient, your sponsoring group must make sure you can afford to start supporting them again for the remaining length of the sponsorship.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trust Funds and Funds held in Trust</h4>
<p>There are two different types of financial accounts that sponsors may establish to demonstrate that they have sufficient funds available for the Sponsorship Application: 1) a formal trust fund; or 2) funds deposited into a chequing or savings account at a Canadian financial institution (funds held in trust). For both types of accounts, funds can be contributed by individuals, groups, and organizations, but refugees cannot contribute any funds. In the event that the refugee is not accepted for resettlement to Canada, funds held in trust for the sponsorship of that refugee, including all accumulated interest, must be returned to the contributors.</p>
<h5>1) Formal trust fund</h5>
<p>Sponsoring groups may establish a formal trust fund with a Canadian financial institution. The individual rights and obligations of the contributors, sponsors and beneficiaries must be set out in the terms of the trust.</p>
<h5>2) Funds deposited into a bank account (funds held in trust).</h5>
<p>This account does not need to be a formal trust account; a chequing or savings account held with a Canadian financial institution is sufficient, provided there is a minimum of two account holders.</p>
<h4>Administrative Fees</h4>
<p>Groups of Five are <strong>not</strong> permitted to charge an administrative fee.</p>
<h4>Cost of Sponsorship</h4>
<h5>Sponsorship cost estimate for your assessment</h5>
<p>You should provide income support to at least the equivalent amount that is provided by the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) in the expected community of settlement, adjusted by any eligible <a href="#inkind">in-kind contributions</a>. The <a href="#costtables">Sponsorship Cost Table</a> gives you only a rough estimate; IRCC uses this information to assess your financial capacity when you apply to sponsor.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Sponsorship Cost Table amount is used for the Sponsorship Application assessment purposes and is <strong>not</strong> the amount that is to be provided as financial support after arrival. Please use the RAP rates in the expected community of settlement to calculate the actual support income you will be required to provide. Some factors, such as in-kind donations or special needs, may impact the amount you need.</p>
<p>You should consider these specific needs in your cost estimate:</p>
<ul>
<li>maternity benefits;</li>
<li>child care;</li>
<li>disability;</li>
<li>age-specific top-ups;</li>
<li>housing supplements;</li>
<li>health-related expenses, such as travel to appointments, and</li>
<li>critical health related expenses not covered through Interim Federal Health (IFH) or provincial health insurance plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>For RAP rates in your community, refer to the <a href="http://www.rstp.ca/en/sponsorship-responsibilities/resettlement-assistance-program-rap-rates/" rel="external">Resettlement Sponsorship Training Program (RSTP)</a>.</p>
<h5>Family Composition</h5>
<p><strong>The Sponsorship Cost table lists the estimated annual settlement cost per family size. For Sponsorship Application purposes, a family is defined as the Principal Applicant plus their spouse or common-law partner, and any biological or legally adopted dependent children or grandchildren who are under 22 when the application is submitted.</strong></p>
<p>If there are linked Sponsorship applications, you should estimate the costs for each family separately. Any adult children who are 22 or older and are applying for Permanent Residence on their own should be considered as a separate family members under the Sponsorship Cost Table.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are submitting an application for a family of four, including the Principal Applicant (PA), his wife, and their two children aged 12 and 14;</li>
<li>a separate, linked application is being submitted for a third child aged 25, and this child’s wife and newborn baby;</li>
<li>even though everyone plans to live together in Canada as one family unit, the financial requirements would be for two separate families instead of one family of 7 individuals;</li>
<li>the minimum annual financial cost would be $28,700 for one family of four, plus $26, 700 for the second family of three. The total <strong>minimum</strong> annual settlement cost for these 2 families including 7 people total would be $55,400.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: these rules apply only to the sponsorship application for the purposes of assessing your financial capacity to sponsor. After the refugees arrive, any adult children over the age of majority in the province they live in are entitled to receive financial support at adult benefit rates, as needed, and adjusted by in-kind contributions.</strong></p>
<h5>Income Support Deductions</h5>
<ul>
<li>The standards for using personal funds and earned income follow the same standards as the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP); however, you may choose to maintain a higher level of income support.</li>
<li>As the refugee starts to earn money, you may be able to lower the monthly financial support.<ul>
<li>Once their net earned income is 50% higher than the RAP rates, you may reduce your support. The total income they earn and get from you must still be at least the minimum they need.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a tax-free monthly payment made to eligible families to help with the cost of raising children under 18.&nbsp;The CCB:<ul>
<li>is available to all Permanent Residents and Canadian Citizens;</li>
<li>cannot be counted as earned income;</li>
<li>cannot be used to calculate reductions to sponsor support;</li>
<li>cannot be counted towards the financial support requirements under the Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program;</li>
<li>has no impact on the minimum amount of financial support a sponsor is required to provide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>For BVORs, you are responsible for providing 6 months of income support, plus start-up costs. The Government of Canada provides an additional 6 months of income support through the Resettlement Assistance Program.</p>
<p><strong>Start-up costs</strong> include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>one-time payment for household items (basic window coverings and common household products such as kitchen utensils, pots, pans, brooms, mops, detergents and cleansers);</li>
<li>furniture (beds, mattresses, dining set, couches, end table and lamps, etc.);</li>
<li>linens (including bedding);</li>
<li>food staples;</li>
<li>both regular and winter clothing;</li>
<li>school registration fees (if applicable).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monthly costs</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>food and incidentals;</li>
<li>housing costs (including utilities);</li>
<li>monthly public transportation passes for all adults;</li>
<li>a communication allowance to cover the costs of a telephone and/or internet connection.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the costs above, you should plan to cover deposits for utilities, phone installation and rental deposit.</p>
<h5 id="inkind">In–Kind donations</h5>
<p>In-kind donations include all donated goods, commodities or services (e.g. gently used furniture or clothing, or housing provided at no cost to the sponsored family). In-kind donations cannot be valued for more than their actual value or the financial benefit they are replacing.</p>
<p>Some items cannot be donated, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>mattresses, which should always be purchased new;</li>
<li>opened food products; and</li>
<li>personal clothing items such as undergarments or footwear.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can subtract the total value of in-kind donations from your estimated sponsorship costs.</p>
<h5>Types of costs that may be deducted through donations (In-kind Deductions)</h5>
<h6>One-time Start-up Costs:</h6>
<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>
<p>Includes basic clothing needs and seasonal needs such as: winter coat, boots, mittens, scarf, snow pants, rain wear, etc.</p>
<p>Note: There are some clothing items that must be purchased new (such as undergarments and footwear). You should also account for personal or cultural clothing preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Furniture</strong></p>
<p>Includes: bed frame or crib, dining set, couches, end table, lamps, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Household Needs</strong></p>
<p>Includes: basic window coverings and common household products such as kitchen utensils, pots, pans, brooms, mops, detergents and cleansers, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Linens</strong></p>
<p>Includes: bedding, towels, etc.</p>
<p><strong>School supplies</strong></p>
<p>Not including registration costs</p>
<p><strong>Food staples</strong></p>
<p>New, unopened pantry items (rice, flour, sugar, spices, etc.) can be donated.</p>
<h6>Ongoing Monthly Costs:</h6>
<p><strong>Shelter</strong></p>
<p>Includes housing costs, utilities, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How to use the In-Kind Deduction Table ($)</strong></p>
<p>Use the table<strong> </strong>below to calculate the maximum value of donated items that can be applied to the financial obligations of the sponsorship</p>
<p>The table is based on annual costs, and includes one-time costs, such as furniture and clothing, and monthly housing costs.</p>
<p>For each in-kind donation you make:</p>
<ul>
<li>estimate the value of the donation;</li>
<li>find the maximum value for it from the table<ul>
<li>if your estimated value is higher than the maximum, use the table value instead;</li>
<li>add the total value of all donations;</li>
<li>subtract the total value of your donations from your estimated sponsorship cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 1: You are applying to sponsor a family of two persons. According to the <strong>Sponsorship Cost Table</strong>, you need a minimum of $ 24 800 to sponsor this family. You donate a gently-used couch, dining table, chairs, lamps, and bookshelves, worth approximately $500. You can deduct this in-kind donation of furniture from the minimum financial requirement, reducing the minimum required sponsorship cost to $ 24300 ($24,800 minus $500).</p>
<p>Example 2: You are sponsoring a family of four persons. According to the <strong>Sponsorship Cost Table</strong>, you need a minimum of $ 28 700 to sponsor this family. You donate a rental property that you manage, which is usually rented for $1,500 per month, or $18,000 per year. Per the <strong>In-kind Deduction Table</strong>, the maximum annual in-kind deduction amount for shelter for a family of four is $11,328. This means that the minimum financial requirement can only be reduced by $11,328, which reduces the minimum required sponsorship cost to $ 17 372 ($28 700 minus $11,328).</p>

        <h3 id="appendixB">Appendix B: Add a Family Member to a PSR Application</h3>
<p>All family members (both accompanying and non-accompanying) <strong>must</strong> be added to an application for permanent residence <strong>before the PA departs for Canada</strong>.</p>
<p>Failing to declare a family member is misrepresentation and may result in the refusal of the application.&nbsp;Declaring family members is also important for family reunification. For example, under the OYW provision, the PA can apply to bring their non-accompanying family members to Canada for up to one year after their arrival in Canada, but <strong>only</strong> if the family members were declared on the application <strong>before</strong> the PA departed for Canada.</p>
<p>Before you or the PA add a family member, <strong>carefully review</strong> the definition of what constitutes a family member under IRPR.&nbsp;<strong>De facto family members are not family members under the regulations and cannot be added to a sponsorship application</strong>.</p>
<p>If you wish to add an accompanying de facto family member, a separate Sponsorship Application package is required. You can link the application by listing it in the Linked/Multiple Sponsorship Undertakings section on the Sponsorship Undertaking form. We will do our best to process the applications at the same time.</p>

<p>If a biological child is born after the PA’s application was received at ROC-O, as per the Sponsorship Undertaking and Settlement Plan form (IMM 5670 - section G Obligations, Consents and Declarations) that you signed, you are automatically responsible for this child as part of your obligations to sponsor.&nbsp;You do <strong>not</strong> need to add this child on a new Sponsorship Undertaking form or submit the Request to Add Family Members to a Private Sponsorship Undertaking form (IMM 5618).</p>
<p>The process to add a biological child after the application was received at ROC-O is the following:</p>
<h6>If you, the sponsor, notifies ROC-O:</h6>
<ul>
<li>sponsor submits the following documents to ROC-O <strong>(<a href="#mailing_address">preferably via email</a>)</strong>:<ul>
<li>an updated Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008) signed by the PA that includes the PA, previously declared and new family members; and</li>
<li>a <strong>copy</strong> of the child’s birth certificate and/or new family UNHCR document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6>If the PA notifies the IRCC office overseas:</h6>
<ul>
<li>the PA submits the following documents to IRCC office overseas <strong>(preferably at the interview or via email)</strong>:<ul>
<li>an updated Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008) signed by the PA that includes the PA, previously declared and new family members.</li>
<li>a <strong>copy</strong> of the child’s birth certificate and/or new family UNHCR document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6>What happens next?</h6>
<p>Once we receive these documents, we will add the new biological child to the PA’s permanent residence application and continue to process it as per regular process.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/stop_sm.gif" alt="stop sign">If a document or signature is missing when you or the PA notifies IRCC, we will send you an email providing you with an opportunity to submit it.&nbsp;Generally, we will provide you with 30 days to answer our email. <strong>If you do not answer our email or if you do not submit the required information within the requested period, the permanent residence application will be refused</strong>. A new sponsorship application for the entire family will need to be submitted to ROC-O.</p>
<h4>If you are adding a:</h4>
<h5>2. A spouse or an adopted child</h5>
<p>If the PA married or if the PA legally adopted a child after the application was received at ROC-O, <strong>they must be added to the Sponsorship Undertaking</strong>.</p>
<p>To avoid delays, <strong>only the sponsors</strong> should advise ROC-O of these new added family members. If the PA contacts the IRCC office overseas, it will delay processing of the application.</p>
<p>The sponsors must submit these documents <strong>(<a href="#mailing_address">preferably via email</a>)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request to Add Family Members to a Private Sponsorship Undertaking form (IMM 5618). The form will be added to the Sponsorship Undertaking for the PA and their family members.</li>
<li>An updated Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008) <strong>signed</strong> by the PA that includes the PA, previously declared family members and new family members.</li>
<li>Schedule A – Background/Declaration (IMM 5669) <strong>signed</strong> by the new family member if they are 18 years or older.</li>
<li>A <strong>copy</strong> of the marriage certificate, birth certificate, adoption certificate and/or a new family UNHCR document (if available).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/information/applications/guides/images/exclamation_sm.gif" class="pull-left mrgn-rght-sm" alt="warning sign">The IMM 008 – <strong>Schedule 2 is not required</strong>.</p>
<h4>Complete the Request to Add Dependant(s) to a Private Sponsorship Undertaking form (IMM 5618)</h4>
<p>The sponsor must complete each of the following sections:</p>
<h5>Section A – Principal Applicant</h5>
<p>Type the name of the PA, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>family name;</li>
<li>given name(s);</li>
<li>date of birth;</li>
<li>application number (G number).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Section B – New Family Members</h5>
<p>Type the name of the new family member, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>family name;</li>
<li>given name(s);</li>
<li>sex;</li>
<li>date of birth;</li>
<li>country of birth; and</li>
<li>relationship to the PA.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Section C – Agreement to Add Family Members</h5>
<p>By checking the “yes” box, you agree to sponsor the additional family members listed in Section B.</p>
<p>By checking the “no” box, your sponsorship and the PA’s permanent residence applications will be refused.</p>
<h5>Section D – Signatures</h5>
<p>Sponsors who signed the sponsorship application must all sign this form.</p>
<h5>What happens next?</h5>
<p>Once we receive these documents, we will add the new family members to the PA’s application and assess whether the sponsorship is still valid.</p>
<p>If the sponsorship continues to be valid, regular processing will continue.</p>
<p>If the sponsorship is no longer valid, the sponsorship and the permanent residence applications will be refused. If the PA finds a new sponsor, a new sponsorship application will need to be submitted at ROC-O.</p>
