        <p>We use the <strong>National Occupational Classification (NOC)</strong> system to classify jobs (occupations). Jobs are grouped based on the type of:</p>
<ul>
<li>job duties</li>
<li>work a person does</li>
</ul>
<p>For immigration purposes, the main job groups are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill Type 0 (zero):</strong> management jobs, such as:<ul>
<li>restaurant managers</li>
<li>mine managers</li>
<li>shore captains (fishing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Skill Level A:</strong> professional jobs that usually call for a degree from a university, such as:<ul>
<li>doctors</li>
<li>dentists</li>
<li>architects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Skill Level B:</strong> technical jobs and skilled trades that usually call for a college diploma or training as an apprentice, such as:<ul>
<li>chefs</li>
<li>plumbers</li>
<li>electricians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Skill Level C:</strong> intermediate jobs that usually call for high school and/or job-specific training, such as:<ul>
<li>industrial butchers</li>
<li>long-haul truck drivers</li>
<li>food and beverage servers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Skill Level D:</strong> labour jobs that usually give on-the-job training, such as:<ul>
<li>fruit pickers</li>
<li>cleaning staff</li>
<li>oil field workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our immigration programs use the NOC to decide if a job or type of work experience meets their eligibility. We consider “skilled” jobs those with NOC Skill Type 0, A or B. We assess jobs against the 2016 version of the NOC.</p>
